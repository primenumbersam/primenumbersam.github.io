abstract: This study investigates the empirical validity of the single-factor Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) at the industry level using monthly data from 1999 to 2023. Employing value-weighted returns across ten industry portfolios, we assess the time variation in market betas, the uncertainty of estimated risk premiums, and the magnitude of conditional pricing errors. Our findings reveal substantial instability in beta estimates, statistically insignificant market risk premia, and persistent alpha deviations—indicating that CAPM omits key structural factors in explaining cross-sectional return differences. These results question the model's robustness as a tool for cost of equity estimation and portfolio construction.

## Introduction

This study investigates the empirical validity of the **single-factor Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** when applied to **value-weighted industry portfolios** over a multi-decade horizon (1999–2023). While the CAPM remains a foundational model in asset pricing theory, its assumptions—such as **static equilibrium** and **constant risk loadings (betas)**—may be unrealistic in dynamic, evolving markets. In this context, we assess whether the model adequately explains cross-sectional return differences at the industry level.

We focus on three core empirical challenges:
1. The **time-variation in industry-specific market betas**, which undermines the model’s assumption of stable covariance structures.
2. The **uncertainty in estimating the market risk premium**, which can distort expected returns and cost-of-capital estimations.
3. The **presence of persistent pricing errors (alphas)** that suggest structural mispricing and potentially omitted risk factors.

Our approach draws on the empirical framework pioneered by Fama and French (1997), extended with contemporary data and methods. Using firm-level CRSP data and SIC-based industry classification, we construct monthly value-weighted portfolios and implement **rolling beta estimations**, **cross-sectional regressions**, and **alpha decomposition** to evaluate the model’s performance.

## Data and Methodology
- **Data Source:**
  - CRSP: Monthly time-series market capitalization data for public stocks listed on Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX from 1994-01 to 2023-12.
  - Fama-French Data Library: Market excess returns (Rm-Rf) and one-month Treasury bill rates as the proxy for the risk-free rate.

- **Time Frequency and Period:** Monthly, covering 30 years (1994-01 to 2023-12), utilizing 5-year rolling windows to estimate monthly industry-specific betas (initial estimation starts from 1999-02).

- **Industry Classification:** Ten major industries defined based on SIC codes:
  - Agriculture, Mining, Construction, Manufacturing, Transportation, Utilities, Wholesale, Retail, Finance, and Services.
  - Adjustment[^1]: Reclassified 'Public' to 'Service', excluded 'Missing'.

[^1]: In this study, firms originally categorized under the “Public” industry in the CRSP database are reassigned to the “Services” industry group. This decision is based on a review of the largest firms within the Public category—such as Tesla, Zoom, Airbnb, PayPal, and Coinbase—which predominantly operate in service-driven, software-based, or platform-oriented business models. Although a few firms like Tesla or Kraft Heinz engage in manufacturing, the overall structure and revenue sources of the Public group are better aligned with the characteristics of modern service industries. This reassignment enhances interpretability in CAPM-based industry comparisons while maintaining consistency in economic logic.

## Model Specification
The single-factor CAPM model used: 

$$
(E[r_i] - r_f)=  \alpha_i + \beta_i (E[r_m] - r_f)
$$

Where:

-   $E[r_i]$: Time-averaged return (i.e., realized net growth rate) of industry portfolio ( i )
-   $r_f$: Time-averaged return of the risk-free asset (e.g., one-month T-bill)
-   $E[r_m]$: Time-averaged return of the **market portfolio**, defined as a **value-weighted convex combination** of all industry portfolios
-   $\beta_i$: Industry-specific market beta, representing the **linear projection coefficient** onto the market excess return under a single-factor model. It is traditionally assumed to be constant under static equilibrium conditions.
-   $\alpha_i$: **Orthogonal component** of the industry portfolio's return relative to the market factor; equivalently, the **mean residual from an orthogonal projection** onto the market return. This term captures either pricing errors under CAPM or the effects of omitted risk factors.

### The Alpha
The interpretation of $\alpha_i$ aligns with the residual term in the linear projection:
 
$$
r_i - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i (r_m - r_f) + \varepsilon_i
$$ 

where $\alpha_i$ is the average component of $\varepsilon_i$, and $\varepsilon_i$ is orthogonal to the regressor. Under ideal CAPM assumptions, $\alpha_i = 0$, but empirically it often deviates from zero due to model misspecification or omitted risk factors.

### Other Logical Analysis
- Consider a hypothetical scenario where one industry (e.g., services) dominates a large portion (e.g., 70%) of the market capitalization, resulting in a **high** linear correlation coefficient between the market portfolio and the dominant industry.
- Analyze another extreme case, where two negatively correlated industries (e.g., services and manufacturing) each consistently control significant market shares (e.g., 45% each), resulting in **minimal** market volatility and ample hedging opportunities.

The sharp increase in Top-5 market capitalization share since the post-2009 period highlights a structural shift toward greater industry concentration—particularly within the transportation, utilities, retail, manufacturing, and services sectors. This trend indicates that a small number of dominant firms increasingly account for a disproportionate share of total industry market value.

While average firm size already suggested this pattern, the Top-5 share offers a direct and quantifiable measure. Notably, the Services sector has experienced a persistent rise in concentration since 2011, likely driven by digital transformation, platform-based business models, and network effects. The Manufacturing sector, meanwhile, remained relatively stable until 2019 before undergoing a rapid increase in dominance, possibly due to technology-driven scale economies.

These developments coincide with macroeconomic shifts following the 2008 financial crisis, including accommodative policies like quantitative easing (QE), which may have reinforced the "winner-takes-most" dynamics. Importantly, this rising concentration may partially explain observed deviations from CAPM predictions, as industry-level returns become increasingly shaped by a few large-cap firms with idiosyncratic risk-return profiles.

### Evolution of Industry Market Cap Shares (1999–2023)

# Merge with factor data and beta
df = (df
  .merge(beta, how="inner", on=["permno", "month"])
  .merge(beta_lag, how="inner", on=["permno", "month"])
  .merge(factors_ff3_monthly, how="inner", on=["month"])
)
```

```{python}
#@title Market Cap Share of industry portfolios
pfo_share = df.pivot_table(index='month', columns='industry', values='mktcap', aggfunc='sum')

# Normalize pfo_share to sum to 1 for each row
pfo_share[:] = pfo_share.div(pfo_share.sum(axis=1), axis=0)

sorted_columns = pfo_share.mean().sort_values(ascending=False).index
pfo_share[sorted_columns].plot(
    kind='line',
    xlabel='month',

```

The market portfolio’s composition—measured by the value-weighted market capitalization share of each industry—has experienced notable structural changes since 1999. While the majority of industries have remained relatively small in terms of aggregate market weight, three sectors—**Manufacturing, Services, and Finance**—have consistently dominated.

In particular, the **Manufacturing** sector's dominance has gradually declined from nearly 50% in 1999 to below 40% in 2023. Conversely, the **Services** sector, especially after absorbing "Public" firms, has expanded significantly, rising from under 20% to over 30% in the same period. The **Finance** sector saw a sharp decline following the 2008 financial crisis and has since stabilized at a lower level.

These compositional shifts reflect evolving patterns in industrial dominance and have direct implications for the **systematic risk profile** of the aggregate market portfolio. As sectoral weights change, so too does the market beta composition underlying the CAPM framework.

Analysis of **value-weighted industry betas** uncovers several important dynamics in the evolution of systematic risk exposures across sectors.

First, the time-series plot shows a **random-walk-like behavior** in beta trajectories, suggesting that industry-level risk exposure is far from stable and must be modeled as time-varying. The boxplot reinforces this heterogeneity:  
- Industries such as **Manufacturing** and **Retail** exhibit **narrow beta distributions**, indicating consistent risk exposure among firms in these sectors.  
- In contrast, **Mining** and **Construction** show **wide dispersion**, pointing to greater intra-industry variability in systematic risk.

A comparison of beta levels also reveals structural asymmetries:  
- **Retail**, **Utilities**, and **Agriculture** maintain beta values consistently **below one**, aligning with their roles as defensive sectors.  
- Conversely, the **Services** sector displays **beta values above one**, along with a rising market cap share—suggesting it has become a key driver of market returns.

This imbalance implies that a **value-weighted market portfolio**—heavily exposed to high-beta sectors—offers **limited hedging potential**, especially in downturns.  
The scatter plot of **mean beta vs. mean market cap share** further illustrates this, with **Manufacturing** standing out as a structural outlier: it holds an average beta near 1 but dominates in market share.  

These findings support a more **strategic allocation to low-beta sectors**, particularly in anticipation of macroeconomic risks. This aligns with recent investment behavior by Buffett, who has increased exposure to **retail-sector firms like Ulta Beauty**, likely as a hedge against cyclical downturns.


### Empirical Testing of CAPM Using Fama-MacBeth Regressions

```{python}
#@title 10 Value-Weighted industry pfos

def weighted_avg(x, weights):
    """Calculates the weighted average of a series."""
    return np.average(x, weights=weights)

# Apply weighted_avg function to pivot_table
pfo_vw_ret_excess = df.pivot_table(
    index='month',
    columns='industry',
    values='ret_excess',
    aggfunc=lambda x: weighted_avg(x, df.loc[x.index, 'mktcap'])
)

pfo_vw_beta_lag = df.pivot_table(
    index='month',
    columns='industry',
    values='beta_lag',
    aggfunc=lambda x: weighted_avg(x, df.loc[x.index, 'mktcap'])
)

mean_vw_beta_lag = pfo_vw_beta_lag.mean().rename('mean_beta_lag')
mean_vw_ret_excess = pfo_vw_ret_excess.mean().rename('mean_ret_excess')

mkt_excess = factors_ff3_monthly['mkt_excess'].mean()
rf = factors_ff3_monthly['rf'].mean()
```

```{python}
#@title Cross-sectional regressions for each month

# Fama-MacBeth (1973) two-pass procedure 

risk_premiums = (df
  .groupby("month")[['ret_excess', 'beta_lag']]
  .apply(lambda x: smf.ols(formula="ret_excess ~ beta_lag", data=x).fit().params)
  .reset_index()
)

# Time-series Aggregation (i.e. average)
# average across the time-series dimension to get the mean risk premium for each characteristic
# calculate t-test statistics for each regressor,
# critical values of 1.96 (at 5% significance) or 2.576 (at 1% significance) for two-tailed significance tests

mean_premiums = (risk_premiums
  .melt(id_vars="month", var_name="factor", value_name="estimate")
  .groupby("factor")["estimate"]
  .apply(lambda x: pd.Series({
      "mean_premium": 100*x.mean(),
      "t_statistic": x.mean()/x.std()*np.sqrt(len(x))
    })
  )
  .reset_index()
  .pivot(index="factor", columns="level_1", values="estimate")
  .reset_index()
)

# reporting standard errors of risk premiums, after adjusting for autocorrelation (Newey and West (1987) standard errors)

mean_premiums_newey_west = (risk_premiums
  .melt(id_vars="month", var_name="factor", value_name="estimate")
  .groupby("factor")
  .apply(lambda x: (
      x["estimate"].mean()/
        smf.ols("estimate ~ 1", x)
        .fit(cov_type="HAC", cov_kwds={"maxlags": 6}).bse
    ), include_groups=False
  )
  .reset_index()
  .rename(columns={"Intercept": "t_statistic_newey_west"})
)

fm_reg = (mean_premiums
  .merge(mean_premiums_newey_west, on="factor")
  .round(3)
)
fm_reg['mean_premium'] = fm_reg['mean_premium']*12

print('Annual Risk Premium of Market Beta')
fm_reg
```

We employ the **Fama-MacBeth (1973) two-pass regression method** to estimate the annualized market risk premium under the single-factor CAPM framework. The first pass consists of estimating rolling betas for each firm, which are then aggregated into value-weighted industry betas. The second pass involves running monthly cross-sectional regressions of industry excess returns on lagged betas from 1999 to 2023. To account for possible serial correlation, we report both naïve t-statistics and Newey-West (1987) adjusted statistics.

The results show a striking pattern:  

- The **estimated intercept (alpha)** averages **9.43% annually**, and this deviation from the theoretical risk-free rate is **statistically significant** (t = 3.89; NW-adjusted t = 3.05).  
- The **estimated beta risk premium**, on the other hand, is only **1.86% annually**, with **no statistical significance** (t = 0.77; NW-adjusted t = 0.73).

This finding leads to two critical implications:

1. The CAPM fails to explain a substantial portion of the cross-sectional variation in industry returns.
2. There is likely a **mispricing component or omitted factor structure** that the single-factor model cannot capture.

From a modeling perspective, the coexistence of a strong alpha and weak beta suggests that estimation errors are compounding: both the time-varying nature of betas and the instability of risk premia contribute to the overall model misspecification. These results are consistent with the view that **industry-specific risk profiles may involve multiple dimensions of risk**, and that static CAPM assumptions are empirically untenable over long horizons.

We visualize the **unconditional Security Market Line (SML)** implied by the single-factor CAPM across 10 value-weighted industry portfolios. Each point on the plot corresponds to an industry, placed according to its **average market beta** (horizontal axis) and **realized average excess return** (vertical axis) over the sample period.

Three lines are shown for comparison:
- The **black dashed line** represents the **theoretical CAPM SML**, where the intercept equals the average risk-free rate and the slope equals the average market risk premium.
- The **red dashed line** is a simple **OLS fit** across the 10 industry points, which minimizes cross-sectional error.
- The **blue dashed line** uses the **Fama-MacBeth estimated intercept**, incorporating pricing errors in the CAPM framework.

Most industry points lie between the CAPM-predicted line and the Fama-MacBeth-adjusted line. This suggests that while the **risk-return relationship remains approximately linear**, the **CAPM fails to account for substantial pricing errors**, as reflected in large intercept terms.

To quantify these deviations more precisely, we calculate **conditional alphas** for each industry. These alphas represent the **difference between realized and CAPM-predicted returns**, conditional on the industry’s average beta.  
- **Positive alpha** implies the industry earned more than predicted by its systematic risk exposure.
- **Negative alpha** suggests overvaluation relative to CAPM expectations.

The results reveal persistent **mispricing across several sectors**, reinforcing earlier conclusions about the model’s empirical inadequacy. The CAPM may still serve as a baseline pricing model, but the presence of **large unexplained returns** calls for either a **multi-factor extension** or a fundamental rethinking of the linear risk-return paradigm.

## Conclusions

This short study evaluates the empirical validity of the single-factor CAPM using value-weighted industry portfolios over a 25-year period (1999–2023). Several key findings emerge:

- **Industry-specific market betas exhibit substantial time variation**, contradicting the CAPM's assumption of stable factor loadings. This instability weakens the model’s explanatory power over long horizons and complicates its use in asset pricing and cost-of-capital estimation.

- The **market risk premium**, when estimated empirically, shows large uncertainty and wide confidence bounds, limiting its practical usefulness in capital budgeting and valuation decisions.

- **Fama-MacBeth regressions reveal economically large and statistically significant intercepts (alphas)**, while the estimated risk premium on beta is both small and statistically insignificant. This suggests that the single-factor CAPM omits important pricing components or fails to capture cross-sectional return dynamics.

- Industry-level CAPM predictions show **structural deviations from theoretical SML predictions**. **Finance and Transportation exhibit relatively low pricing errors**, potentially due to regulatory distortions (e.g., “Too Big to Fail”) or reduced market responsiveness.

- Lastly, the increasing dominance of a few large-cap firms—particularly in Services and Manufacturing—implies that **market-wide returns are increasingly shaped by concentrated industry dynamics**. This structural concentration further limits the diversification benefits assumed under standard portfolio theory.

Overall, while CAPM remains a foundational framework in asset pricing, this analysis highlights its limitations in capturing the complexities of modern equity markets—particularly when applied at the industry level over long horizons.
