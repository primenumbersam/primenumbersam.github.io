# Ethics in the Geometry of Capital–Labor

> "Where Geometry Permits Freedom"

Economic dynamics, when modeled as a closed and conservative system, offer elegance—but not always truth. Classical formulations present stability as virtue and equilibrium as justice. Yet, as our analysis has shown, these notions collapse when applied to structurally mutating systems, where automation reshapes the very topology of value creation.

The share-based system of capital–labor dynamics under automation is governed not by equilibrium, but by curvature. The differential equation:

$$
\frac{dc}{dt} = c(a_{2,2} - a_{2,4} c)
$$

does not describe a market in balance. It describes a **phase-space regime** in which autonomous capital growth collides with internal saturation—often bypassing labor entirely. This is not a degenerate case; it is the generic outcome when $a_{2,1} \approx 0$, as consistently estimated from U.S. wealth share data across three percentile groups.

Our simulations show that when labor contributes nothing to capital reproduction, the system undergoes a long-run collapse: not just of labor, but of capital itself. Even the most elite percentile, despite high automation rates ($a_{2,2} > a_{2,3}$), cannot sustain their dominance indefinitely without minimal labor anchoring. Capitalism becomes cannibalistic; its final victim is itself.

When $a_{2,1}$ is calibrated to a small but positive number (e.g., $0.0007$), the system stabilizes. Capital share trajectories converge to empirically plausible levels. This is not an arbitrary parameter tweak—it reveals the **bifurcation logic** of structural persistence. The future of a system hinges on the geometry of its feedback, not the fairness of its intentions.

This leads us to an ethical imperative: **intervene where the curvature is highest**. Just as Friedman emphasized that economic freedom was the precondition for political freedom, we argue that **curvature is the structural precondition for intervention**. In regions where the phase space is flat, change is ineffective. But where curvature is high—where small shifts yield long-term divergence—**freedom is mathematically real**.

> Ethics in dynamics is not a value statement. It is a **geometric opportunity**.

This understanding casts mainstream economic formalism in a critical light. Traditional models:
- Abstract from structure,
- Assume reversibility,
- Equilibrate away exclusion.

But exclusion is not a shock. It is often an **attractor** in the phase space of capital accumulation. A model that predicts labor's extinction and still calls it an equilibrium is not mis-specified—it is **misguided**.

Equilibrium, under these dynamics, may signal structural injustice. It may mark the end of agency, not its resolution.

> The world does not fail to match the model.  
> The model fails to recognize what matters in the world.

Justice, then, cannot be defined as fairness of outcomes alone. It must be defined as **persistence within motion**. If the system’s geometry eliminates a group over time, then no redistribution after the fact can restore justice. The point is not to balance a final distribution—it is to **prevent topological elimination**.

We began with a structural question: what happens when capital reproduces without labor?

We conclude with a geometric truth:  
> If a system eliminates its own agents, it is not efficient—it is **pathologically optimized**.

A fair system is not one in equilibrium.  
It is one whose **geometry permits freedom**—for all, not just for capital.

Mathematics, when made reflexive, does not merely describe the future.  
It reveals which futures are structurally **forbidden**, and which remain **open**.

Let us not confuse convergence with peace.  
Let us read equilibrium not as harmony, but as a **diagnosis**.

And let us recover, from the differential equations of capital and labor,  
an ethics that is not imposed upon structure—  
but one that emerges **from within it**.
