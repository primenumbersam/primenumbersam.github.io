    This paper explains monetary policy effects using neoclassical economics and monetarism perspectives, contrasting them with New Keynesian views. Through theoretical models (Friedman, Aiyagari, Bewley, Harrison &amp; Kreps), it shows that incomplete markets and heterogeneous agents can cause monetary policy to unintentionally worsen inequality and distort markets. Policymakers should thus carefully consider these market imperfections to promote long-term stability and mitigate distributional distortions.

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Neoclassical economics emphasizes that rational individuals base decisions primarily on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations. In this view, rational agents with forward-looking expectations base decisions on an infinite-horizon optimization, meaning they will not invest in assets or projects that have a declining long-term trajectory or negative net present value. Market prices, in turn, are thought to reflect these rational expectations about future fundamentals. This philosophy is exemplified in models of Milton Friedman and his successors, where individuals smooth consumption over time and focus on permanent income, and in modern macroeconomic models that assume agents plan for the long run. The neoclassical mindset links naturally with Friedman’s monetarism, which asserts that steady, rules-based growth of the money supply yields better outcomes than reactive fine-tuning. Both frameworks assume that people anticipate the future well, so erratic policy shifts mainly lead to price changes rather than lasting gains in output or employment. Representative models include Friedman’s Permanent Income Hypothesis, Bewley’s incomplete-market model, Aiyagari’s general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, and the speculative asset-pricing model by Harrison &amp; Kreps <span class="citation" data-cites="friedman1957theory bewley1986stationary aiyagari1994uninsured harrison1978speculative">(<a href="#ref-friedman1957theory" role="doc-biblioref">Friedman 1957</a>; <a href="#ref-bewley1986stationary" role="doc-biblioref">Bewley 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-aiyagari1994uninsured" role="doc-biblioref">Aiyagari 1994</a>; <a href="#ref-harrison1978speculative" role="doc-biblioref">Harrison and Kreps 1978</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Friedman’s monetarism closely aligns with neoclassical thinking, promoting predictable, rules-based monetary policy to ensure market stability and long-term neutrality of money. In contrast, Keynesian and New Keynesian frameworks highlight the importance of short-term interventions due to market frictions such as price stickiness. New Keynesians agree that people are forward-looking, but they highlight that wages and prices can be “sticky” (slow to adjust), which prevents markets from clearing quickly. As a result, even rational agents may be temporarily unable to reach optimal outcomes, and monetary policy can have powerful real effects in the short term. For example, if prices cannot adjust immediately, an unexpected cut in interest rates may boost real spending and output rather than just raising prices. New Keynesian models therefore rationalize active stabilization policy – they contend that without it, the economy can suffer prolonged recessions or unemployment that a well-timed policy intervention could ameliorate. This stands in contrast to the monetarist/neoclassical view that markets self-correct relatively quickly. Despite these differences, both schools provide valuable insight: neoclassical and monetarist models offer clarity about long-run tendencies and private sector behavior under rational expectations, while Keynesian models stress the importance of short-run dynamics and coordination failures. The analysis in this paper bridges these perspectives by using theoretical models to examine how <strong>market imperfections</strong> – such as incomplete markets and heterogeneous expectations – modify the standard predictions. Although the models are abstract, each provides important long-term policy guidance. Understanding their lessons can help policymakers design monetary strategies that foster stability without creating new problems in the process.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-assumptions-of-neoclassical-economics-and-monetarism"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Core Assumptions of Neoclassical Economics and Monetarism</h2>
<p>Three core assumptions underpin the neoclassical and monetarist perspective in macroeconomics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rational expectations and infinite-horizon optimization:</strong> Individuals and firms are assumed to form expectations about the future in a rational way (using all available information) and to optimize their decisions over an infinite time horizon. In practice, this means economic agents base current consumption, saving, and investment on the expected present value of long-term outcomes, rather than overreacting to short-lived changes. They anticipate the future effects of policies, so systematic policy actions are largely already “priced in” to decisions. This assumption was emphasized by the new classical economists who followed Friedman, such as Robert Lucas, in arguing that only unexpected policy moves affect real behavior in the short run. Under rational expectations, people won’t persistently spend windfalls or chase assets whose fundamentals don’t justify their price, since they foresee the eventual reversion to fundamental value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Market clearing in the long run (flexible prices):</strong> Neoclassical models typically assume that prices of goods, services, and factors adjust to equilibrate supply and demand, at least in the long run. While short-term frictions can occur, the long-run default is an economy at full employment with resources fully utilized. Any deviations (recessions or booms) are seen as temporary, provided policy does not introduce long-term distortions. This view contrasts with Keynesian models where wages or prices might remain out of equilibrium for an extended period. The neoclassical stance is that given enough time, economic forces will push the economy back to its potential output with stable growth. Monetarists, too, believed that “markets naturally move toward a stable center” in the absence of big shocks. Thus, they argue against aggressive intervention that attempts to exploit short-run trade-offs (like pumping up output at the cost of higher inflation), because eventually prices adjust and only inflation remains.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neutrality of money regarding real economic outcomes in the long run:</strong><span class="citation" data-cites="lucas1972expectations friedman1968role">(<a href="#ref-lucas1972expectations" role="doc-biblioref">Lucas Jr 1972</a>; <a href="#ref-friedman1968role" role="doc-biblioref">Friedman 1968</a>)</span>. A cornerstone of monetarism and neoclassical thought is that changes in the money supply only have transient effects on real variables (output, employment) and no effect in the long run. In the long run, an exogenous increase in the money stock is reflected in higher nominal prices and wages, but real consumption, investment, and output return to their original path. In other words, money is “neutral” with respect to real economic activity once prices have fully adjusted. Most economists agree that this long-run neutrality holds approximately true in practice – doubling the money supply eventually doubles the price level – and monetarists place great importance on it. This assumption underlies the monetarist recommendation to avoid monetary surprises: any attempt to permanently boost employment by printing money will just create inflation once people’s expectations catch up. Rational agents, thinking in an infinite-horizon framework, will not be tricked for long; they come to expect higher inflation, negating any output gains. Monetary policy, therefore, is seen primarily as a tool for controlling inflation and nominal variables, not as a way to engineer long-term higher growth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These core assumptions shape the policy mindset in the neoclassical/monetarist framework. If agents are highly forward-looking and markets tend to clear, discretionary stabilization policy has limited power – it might only cause short-term blips or even destabilize expectations. Instead, maintaining credible, consistent policy (such as a steady money growth rule or inflation target) is viewed as the optimal approach for long-run welfare. In the next sections, we examine how relaxing some of these assumptions – by introducing incomplete markets, borrowing constraints, or heterogeneous beliefs – changes the conclusions and policy implications.</p>

<section id="complete-vs.-incomplete-markets" class="level2" data-number="3">
<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complete-vs.-incomplete-markets"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Complete vs.&nbsp;Incomplete Markets</h2>
<p>Complete markets allow full insurance against risks and unlimited borrowing, resulting in smooth consumption aligned with permanent income. Incomplete markets, however, feature borrowing constraints and uninsurable shocks, creating heterogeneity and precautionary savings, leading to wealth disparities and more volatile consumption patterns <span class="citation" data-cites="aiyagari1994uninsured bewley1986stationary">(<a href="#ref-aiyagari1994uninsured" role="doc-biblioref">Aiyagari 1994</a>; <a href="#ref-bewley1986stationary" role="doc-biblioref">Bewley 1986</a>)</span>. Thus, one fundamental way real economies depart from the idealized benchmark is that <strong>markets are incomplete</strong>. In a <em>complete market</em> environment, individuals can fully insure against uncertainties and can borrow or save freely at a given interest rate. In that ideal case, people smooth their consumption over time nearly perfectly. Consumption ends up being much less volatile than income, because during bad times individuals can borrow or draw on savings, and during good times they can save extra income for the future. In fact, theory predicts that with complete markets, consumption at any point reflects an individual’s <em>permanent income</em> (the expected long-term average income), not the transitory ups and downs of current income. A direct implication is that temporary policy measures (like one-time stimulus checks or short-lived tax cuts) would have only a small effect on consumption—because rational consumers know such windfalls are transitory, they prefer to save a large portion of them, aiming to maintain a stable consumption path. In a complete market, households effectively pool risks and smooth out idiosyncratic shocks; as a result, their spending is steady and mainly influenced by changes in expected lifetime resources rather than short-term liquidity fluctuations.</p>
<p>By contrast, in <strong>incomplete market</strong> settings, individuals do not have access to perfect insurance or unlimited borrowing. They face idiosyncratic income shocks (e.g., job loss, illness) that they must largely bear on their own. Additionally, they may encounter <strong>liquidity constraints</strong> or borrowing limits that prevent them from smoothing consumption fully. The models developed by Truman Bewley, S. Rao Aiyagari, and others formalize this situation. In these models, all agents are ex ante identical (they have the same preferences and potential income distribution), but they become <strong>ex post heterogeneous</strong> because each experiences different income shocks over time and they cannot completely insure against these shocks <span class="citation" data-cites="bewley1986stationary aiyagari1994uninsured">(<a href="#ref-bewley1986stationary" role="doc-biblioref">Bewley 1986</a>; <a href="#ref-aiyagari1994uninsured" role="doc-biblioref">Aiyagari 1994</a>)</span>. Households thus engage in <strong>precautionary saving</strong>—they tend to save more when they have income, building a buffer of assets to self-insure against future bad draws. Consumption is no longer completely smooth; when a negative shock hits a liquidity-constrained household, it may have to cut consumption sharply because it cannot borrow easily. Conversely, a positive shock to a hand-to-mouth household leads to a spike in consumption if they were previously constrained.</p>
<p>Incomplete markets therefore produce higher <em>marginal propensities to consume</em> out of transitory income changes—in other words, constrained people would spend a larger fraction of any temporary income windfall than they would under complete markets <span class="citation" data-cites="aiyagari1994uninsured">(<a href="#ref-aiyagari1994uninsured" role="doc-biblioref">Aiyagari 1994</a>)</span>. This is consistent with empirical data showing many households, especially those with low wealth, quickly spend stimulus payments or bonuses, as they have unmet needs or debts to pay.</p>
<p>Another key difference is that incomplete markets generate a non-trivial <strong>distribution of wealth</strong>. Since each individual’s asset accumulation depends on their history of shocks and their precautionary saving motive, over time the economy develops inequality in wealth and consumption. Some agents will build up sizable precautionary balances (if they experience good income luck or have frugal preferences), while others might remain near the borrowing constraint with minimal savings. The wealth distribution in such models is typically <strong>highly skewed</strong>, capturing the fact that a small fraction of people may hold a large share of total assets – a feature very much in line with real-world data. By contrast, in a representative agent or complete markets model, distributional issues are either absent or of no consequence, since everyone effectively pools risks together. Incomplete markets thus bring distributional considerations to the forefront of macroeconomic analysis.</p>
<p>For policymakers, these differences mean that monetary and fiscal policy can have <strong>uneven effects</strong> across the population and can influence aggregate demand through channels that are muted in complete-market models. For example, an interest rate cut in an incomplete market setting might stimulate borrowing and spending for some agents, but for others it mainly reduces their interest income (if they are savers), potentially widening inequality. Likewise, a government stimulus targeted at liquidity-constrained households could yield a relatively large boost to consumption (due to their high propensity to consume out of additional income), whereas the same payment to a wealthier, fully insured household might just be saved. In summary, incomplete markets make the macroeconomy less “frictionless” and more sensitive to distribution and credit conditions. We next examine specific models that incorporate these features, to draw out their policy insights.</p>
<section id="friedman-consumption-smoothing-model-complete-markets" class="level3" data-number="3.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friedman-consumption-smoothing-model-complete-markets"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Friedman Consumption Smoothing Model (Complete Markets)</h3>
<p>Milton Friedman’s model of consumption – known as the <strong>Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH)</strong> – suggests consumption depends primarily on permanent rather than temporary income changes. Hence, monetary policy must focus on long-term credibility rather than short-run stimulus <span class="citation" data-cites="friedman1957theory hall1978stochastic">(<a href="#ref-friedman1957theory" role="doc-biblioref">Friedman 1957</a>; <a href="#ref-hall1978stochastic" role="doc-biblioref">Hall 1978</a>)</span>. This is a cornerstone of the neoclassical view on consumption behavior. Friedman proposed that an individual’s consumption at any given time is determined not by current income alone, but by their <strong>permanent income</strong>, which is the expected long-term average income. Temporary fluctuations in income, according to this theory, have only a small effect on consumption because people use saving and borrowing to smooth out those fluctuations. In other words, households act like long-term planners: if they receive an unexpectedly high income this year, they will not dramatically raise their spending, understanding that the extra income may not last. Instead, they will save most of it (or pay down debt), spreading the benefit over future years. Conversely, if income dips briefly, they can draw on past savings or borrow to maintain their usual consumption level, expecting to repay when income recovers. This behavior leads to relatively <strong>stable</strong> consumption paths, as illustrated by Friedman’s famous observation that consumption is much smoother than the often volatile income streams that individuals experience year to year.</p>
<p>Friedman’s model assumes that credit markets function well (people can borrow against future income) and that consumers are forward-looking and rational. Under these conditions, <strong>monetary and fiscal policy have limited ability to alter consumption unless they affect expected long-term income</strong>. For example, a one-time tax rebate or a temporarily lower interest rate might not stimulate much extra spending – consumers recognize that this is a short-term change. Indeed, a key takeaway of the permanent income theory is that <strong>policies which only increase current income without raising expected future income will mostly lead to higher saving rather than higher spending</strong>. Friedman contrasted this with the Keynesian view in which consumers have a high marginal propensity to consume out of current income (perhaps because they are myopic or liquidity-constrained). He argued that the Keynesian assumption was flawed in ignoring forward-looking behavior. Empirical puzzles of the mid-20th century (such as why consumption didn’t rise one-for-one with income gains from, say, war-time fiscal expansions) could be explained by PIH: people understood those income gains were temporary and saved much of them.</p>
<p>In policy terms, the Friedman consumption model supports a rather conservative use of demand management. A central bank that rapidly expands money or lowers interest rates might not trigger a large consumption boom unless people believe those actions will persist and raise their permanent income or wealth. Similarly, a government stimulus check will be partly saved if households treat it as a transitory windfall. An important implication is that <strong>discretionary policy “surprises” are not a reliable way to boost aggregate demand</strong> – rational agents will react mainly to the expected persistent components of policy. Monetarists like Friedman instead advocated <strong>rule-based policies</strong> (such as steadily growing the money supply at a fixed rate) to provide a stable environment for consumers and investors to plan. If policy is erratic, it could even be counterproductive: for instance, trying to exploit a short-run trade-off by pushing unemployment lower than its natural rate would just raise inflation expectations, with little lasting benefit to output (this is essentially Friedman’s adaptive expectations version of the Phillips Curve argument). In summary, Friedman’s complete-market consumption model underscores the importance of expectations and permanent income. It suggests that <strong>monetary policy should focus on the long-term nominal stability</strong> (controlling inflation) and avoid frequent discretionary shifts, because people will see through those shifts and adjust their saving behavior accordingly. It also implies that fiscal stabilization (e.g.&nbsp;stimulus payments) will be most effective when aimed at households likely to be liquidity-constrained, a point that becomes clearer once we consider incomplete market models.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="consumption-investment-trade-off-under-liquidity-constraints"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Consumption-Investment Trade-off under Liquidity Constraints</h3>
<p>Liquidity constraints disrupt optimal consumption-investment trade-offs. Constrained agents cannot invest sufficiently during downturns, weakening monetary policy’s effectiveness, particularly in stimulating investment or consumption among constrained households. For example, consider a household facing liquidity constraints and uncertain future income. An interest rate cut reduces the returns on their precautionary savings, forcing the household to reduce the buffer stock meant to protect against income fluctuations. Consequently, this household may have limited resources available for productive investments such as education or small business expansion. Younger or non-saver households facing liquidity constraints prioritize current consumption over future consumption due to diminishing marginal returns of future utility. Thus, when interest rates decrease, these households are more likely to immediately spend additional available funds rather than accumulate precautionary savings or invest in long-term productive assets. In contrast, a wealthier, unconstrained household may use lower interest rates to cheaply finance additional investment opportunities, potentially increasing their wealth relative to constrained households.</p>
<p>A central theme in a standard intertemporal choice problem is the <strong>trade-off between consuming today and investing for tomorrow</strong>. In a frictionless world, consumers equate the marginal benefit of spending an extra dollar today with the marginal benefit of saving that dollar (investing it to spend later). This optimality condition (often called the Euler equation in macroeconomics) ensures that resources are allocated to their most valued use over time. However, in reality many households and firms face <strong>liquidity constraints</strong> or borrowing limits that prevent them from freely making this trade-off. Such constraints are a key imperfection that alters the impact of monetary policy and other shocks.</p>
<p>When agents are liquidity-constrained, they cannot borrow as much as they would like against future income. This means in bad times they might <em>want</em> to maintain consumption or invest in opportunities (human capital, business expansion, etc.), but they simply lack the funds or credit access to do so. Consequently, current consumption may fall below the level that would be chosen under complete markets, and valuable investments might be foregone. For instance, a skilled worker who becomes unemployed may cut back sharply on consumption – not because their lifetime income prospects are shattered, but because in that moment they don’t have liquid assets or credit to smooth over the gap. Likewise, a small business might pass up a profitable investment because banks refuse credit due to the firm’s lack of collateral. These scenarios lead to a suboptimal allocation of resources over time, amplifying short-run fluctuations and causing longer-run consequences (lost growth from underinvestment, etc.).</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, liquidity constraints mean that <strong>monetary policy may have an asymmetric effect</strong>. If the central bank raises interest rates, it generally cools off borrowing and spending – both unconstrained and constrained agents will cut back (the former by choice, the latter perhaps by necessity as credit becomes more expensive or scarce). But if the central bank lowers interest rates to stimulate the economy, those who are constrained might <em>still</em> be unable to borrow (banks may not lend to them even at low rates, if their balance sheet is weak or job uncertain) and thus cannot increase consumption or investment. In other words, there is a segment of the population for whom monetary easing doesn’t translate into more spending because they were not borrowing in the first place (they were at their borrowing limit). Instead, the stimulus might mainly induce already well-capitalized agents to borrow or invest more – which can have distributional effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, consider fiscal policy: a transfer (like a stimulus check or unemployment benefit extension) given to a liquidity-constrained household is likely to be spent in large part, precisely because that household’s consumption was suppressed by lack of funds. Empirical evidence and incomplete-market models both find that households with little liquid wealth have <strong>high marginal propensities to consume (MPCs)</strong> out of such transfers. This contrasts with the near-zero MPC out of a transitory income increase for a fully smoothed consumer in Friedman’s framework. Therefore, liquidity constraints reconcile why Keynesian-style demand stimulus can work in practice (many people do spend most of an extra dollar if they were cash-strapped), even though Friedman’s theory might suggest they shouldn’t. Modern heterogeneous agent models incorporate this insight by showing that when a large fraction of consumers are hand-to-mouth or buffer-stock savers, aggregate consumption is sensitive to the distribution of income and cash-on-hand.</p>
<p>For investment, liquidity constraints imply that not all investment opportunities are realized, especially among smaller firms or entrepreneurs, if external finance is costly or unavailable. In a recession, even if the central bank slashes interest rates, banks may be risk-averse and tighten lending standards, so only the safest borrowers benefit from low rates. This can lead to a situation often described as “pushing on a string,” where monetary policy loses traction in stimulating additional private investment or consumption because the bottleneck is in credit access, not the cost of credit per se.</p>
<p>In summary, the consumption-investment trade-off under liquidity constraints highlights that <strong>market imperfections can dampen or distort the transmission of monetary policy</strong>. A perfectly rational, unconstrained agent might respond to lower interest rates by optimally borrowing and spending more (since the opportunity cost of funds is lower). But a constrained agent does nothing (they can’t borrow anyway), and an unconstrained wealthy agent might already be satiated in consumption and only shift their portfolio. These dynamics mean that in downturns, monetary policy might need support from fiscal measures that <strong>target</strong> constrained agents to be fully effective. It also means that policymakers should be aware of credit conditions and possibly use regulatory tools to ensure that rate cuts get passed through to borrowers. The general principle is that <strong>in the presence of liquidity constraints, short-run fluctuations can have long-run costs (foregone investment, lower human capital accumulation) and policies should aim to alleviate these constraints during bad times</strong>.</p>

</ul>
<p>The <strong>Bewley model</strong> (named after economist Truman Bewley) is a foundational framework for analyzing incomplete markets with heterogeneous agents. In Bewley’s setup, we consider a large number of infinitely-lived consumers who face <strong>idiosyncratic income shocks</strong> in each period. These shocks are uninsurable – there is no complete set of insurance markets for them – and consumers can only trade a single risk-free asset (such as a bond or money) to self-insure. Moreover, consumers face a <strong>borrowing limit</strong> (they cannot have debt beyond a certain level, often this ad hoc level is set to zero for simplicity). Despite all consumers having <strong>the same preferences and income process ex ante</strong>, the randomness of shocks makes them <strong>heterogeneous ex post</strong> in terms of their asset holdings and current income. This type of model is often called a <em>heterogeneous agent incomplete-markets model</em>, or simply a <strong>Bewley model</strong>, after the seminal work in <span class="citation" data-cites="bewley1986stationary">(<a href="#ref-bewley1986stationary" role="doc-biblioref">Bewley 1986</a>)</span>. It has become a workhorse for understanding consumption, saving, and wealth distribution under uncertainty.</p>
<p>In the Bewley model, each consumer solves a <strong>consumption-saving problem</strong>: how much to consume today versus save as a buffer for future uncertainty. A typical finding is the emergence of a <strong>precautionary saving motive</strong> – people save not just for lifecycle reasons (retirement, etc.) but also to buffer against income risk. Those who experience good shocks build up assets, while those hit by bad shocks draw down assets or if they have none, they hit the borrowing constraint and their consumption drops. Over time, the model reaches an equilibrium where the <strong>cross-sectional distribution of wealth is stationary</strong> (in a statistical sense): some fraction of the population has high wealth, some has low wealth, with persistent inequality generated purely from idiosyncratic risk and saving behavior. This equilibrium typically features a <strong>fat-tailed distribution</strong>, meaning there are some very high-wealth individuals (who had a run of good shocks or especially strong saving discipline) and a significant mass of low-wealth individuals who might be frequently at the edge of the borrowing constraint. Quantitatively, such models can generate wealth concentration that qualitatively resembles that observed in real economies (though matching the extreme concentration in actual data often requires adding other elements like heterogeneity in earnings ability or rates of return).</p>
<p>One key aspect of the Bewley model is that the interest rate is treated as exogenous (or determined outside the model, say by a central bank or a global capital market). In other words, Bewley’s original formulation is a <strong>partial equilibrium</strong> analysis: it looks at an individual’s optimal saving given an interest rate, but does not necessarily determine that interest rate from within the model. This is akin to studying a small open economy where people can save or borrow at a fixed world interest rate, or a situation with a perfectly elastic supply of funds. Under this fixed interest rate, not everyone can dissave indefinitely because of the borrowing constraint, so in aggregate there will typically be positive net saving (since precautionary motives induce people to hold assets). If the interest rate is high relative to people’s time preference and risk, the low-wealth agents will borrow up to the limit and the high-wealth will save a lot, and an equilibrium wealth distribution forms. If the interest rate is too high, precautionary saving might not be enough to sustain it (people try to borrow too much); if it’s too low, people accumulate assets and the economy might reach a point where the lowest wealth is at the borrowing limit and highest is still saving – typically there is some interest rate that balances asset demand and the “excess” of precautionary saving.</p>
<p>While the technical details can be involved, the intuition gleaned from the Bewley model is powerful for policy. It shows how <strong>incomplete markets alone (without any price rigidity or aggregate shocks) can lead to under-consumption by some and the accumulation of large buffers by others</strong>. This has implications for long-run growth and inequality. If many people are constrained and cannot invest in their education or businesses, the economy might underperform its potential. It also implies that policies like social insurance (unemployment insurance, social security, etc.) can affect aggregate outcomes: for example, providing more generous unemployment benefits might reduce the need for precautionary saving, which could actually stimulate consumption among lower-wealth households and reduce inequality. On the flip side, too generous a safety net could reduce the incentive to save at all. Bewley-type models have been used to examine optimal policy in this context, such as what level of unemployment insurance optimally trades off providing insurance versus maintaining incentives.</p>
<p>An important extension of the Bewley model is to use it for <strong>wealth distribution insights</strong>. The model clarifies that even if everyone has identical earning potential, incomplete markets will generate inequality simply due to luck and precautionary behavior. This suggests that some observed inequality is not due to differences in skill or hard work, but due to insufficient insurance against life’s risks. Policymakers concerned with excessive inequality might draw on this insight to justify progressive taxation or public insurance programs that effectively do what missing markets would have – help smooth incomes and consumption across states of the world. Indeed, one policy implication highlighted in such models is that improving access to credit for credit-worthy but constrained households, or providing more public insurance, could make the overall economy better off by allowing more efficient consumption and investment choices (though there are always trade-offs and moral hazard issues to consider).</p>
<p>In summary, the Bewley model provides a micro-founded explanation for why some people end up liquidity-constrained and how that influences their behavior. For monetary policy, it warns that aggregate demand may be more sensitive to the distribution of wealth and income than traditional models would suggest – if a recession hits the lower-wealth population hard, their consumption will contract strongly (since they can’t borrow), potentially deepening the downturn. Purely focusing on interest rates as a lever might be insufficient; fiscal redistributive tools or direct transfers could be more potent in such scenarios. The model’s relevance has grown as economists recognize the limitations of the representative-agent paradigm and seek to incorporate heterogeneous agent effects into macroeconomic policy analysis.</p>

</ul>
<p>S. Rao Aiyagari’s model builds directly on the Bewley framework but adds an important layer: a production economy that yields a <strong>general equilibrium</strong> determination of prices (interest rate and possibly wages). In the Aiyagari (1994) model, we still have infinitely-lived agents with idiosyncratic income shocks and borrowing constraints (precisely the Bewley setup on the household side), but now those households supply savings to, and borrow from, a productive sector with capital. In essence, Aiyagari embeds the precautionary savings behavior into a full macroeconomic model with capital accumulation. The result is a self-contained macroeconomic equilibrium where the <strong>interest rate is endogenously determined</strong> by the supply and demand for capital, rather than being fixed externally. Households’ collective saving (driven by precautionary motives) feeds into the capital stock, and firms’ demand for capital (based on productivity and diminishing returns) determines the equilibrium interest rate that clears the capital market.</p>
<p>One of Aiyagari’s key findings is that in an economy with uninsurable income risk, the equilibrium interest rate will generally be <strong>lower</strong> than it would be in a comparable complete-markets economy. Intuitively, because households value holding assets as a buffer (beyond what they would in a no-risk scenario), they tend to save more, which pushes down the return to capital. In other words, there is <strong>excess aggregate saving due to precautionary motives</strong>, leading to a larger capital stock and lower interest rate than the classical model without income risk would predict. This is sometimes referred to as the “Aiyagari excess capital result.” It implies that the laissez-faire outcome might not be socially optimal – there could be “too much” capital from a certain perspective, because individuals don’t internalize that by saving so much for themselves, they depress the return for everyone. One practical implication Aiyagari pointed out is that a government could improve welfare by taxing capital income and redistributing it (or using it to fund social insurance) in such an economy. By doing so, it reduces the need for individuals to self-insure via excessive capital accumulation, potentially moving the economy closer to the golden-rule level of capital (where consumption is maximized). This was a striking result since in a standard frictionless model, capital taxation is often detrimental in the long run – but here, moderate capital taxation can correct an inefficiency arising from incomplete markets.</p>
<p>The Aiyagari model also provides insight into the interplay between <strong>inequality and aggregate production</strong>. Unlike the Bewley model, which was partial equilibrium, here the <strong>distribution of wealth affects aggregate supply</strong> (through capital accumulation). If the wealth is concentrated in fewer hands, the aggregate consumption could be lower (since wealthy individuals have lower MPCs, they might save a lot of their income), and the aggregate capital might be higher (since those with excess wealth invest it). This has led to extensive research on the quantitative impact of redistributive policies on growth and output. For instance, if you redistribute wealth from the rich (low MPC) to the poor (high MPC), you might raise current consumption but reduce saving and thus future capital – whether that is good or bad for long-run output depends on parameters, but in some cases it can actually increase output if the economy was above the golden rule level of capital to start with <span class="citation" data-cites="MARCET20072621">(<a href="#ref-MARCET20072621" role="doc-biblioref">Marcet, Obiols-Homs, and Weil 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another aspect is the <strong>feedback of interest rates on inequality</strong>. In Aiyagari’s equilibrium, the interest rate settles at a level where households are indifferent between saving and not saving (on the margin). If interest rates are very low, borrowing is cheap, but also the reward for saving is low, which could discourage some saving. However, typically in these models many households still save because of risk aversion and precaution. The low interest rate also means that those who are borrowing-constrained are not paying a huge interest burden (assuming they can borrow at that rate), but many cannot borrow much anyway due to the constraint. Overall, compared to a representative-agent model, the Aiyagari model predicts different responses to monetary policy. For example, if the central bank lowers the interest rate (below the equilibrium that would prevail from just technology and time preference), it transfers resources from savers to borrowers. In an economy with inequality, this has non-neutral effects: borrowers (often poorer agents) gain relief and might consume more, while savers (wealthier agents) earn less on their assets and might consume less (or seek riskier investments). The <strong>distributional effects of monetary policy</strong> come into play. Recent research in heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) models builds on this by adding nominal rigidities, but even in the basic Aiyagari model, one can see that monetary policy is not just about one representative agent’s intertemporal choice – it will create winners and losers due to heterogeneity in assets and consumption propensities.</p>
<p>For policymakers, Aiyagari’s work underscores a few points: (1) <strong>Monetary neutrality may not hold cleanly in the short run</strong> even if prices are flexible, because redistributions caused by interest rate changes can affect aggregate demand; (2) there may be a role for <strong>permanent fiscal policy</strong> (like capital taxation or debt issuance) to influence the long-run capital stock and interest rate in a way that improves welfare, countering the incomplete-market externality; (3) evaluating monetary policy requires understanding the underlying wealth distribution – for instance, a low interest rate environment will tend to benefit borrowers and younger households (via cheaper credit, higher asset values) while hurting those who rely on interest income (like pensioners or wealthier rentiers). If mismanaged, prolonged ultra-low rates can contribute to asset price inflation (as savers seek returns in real estate or stocks), thereby <strong>widening wealth inequality</strong> if only the already-wealthy hold those appreciating assets. Indeed, some attribute the rise in asset valuations and wealth concentration in recent decades partly to very low global real interest rates and ample liquidity, consistent with the mechanisms in Aiyagari-type models.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Aiyagari model enriches our understanding by marrying heterogeneity with production. It reminds us that <strong>macroeconomic policy cannot be divorced from distributional considerations</strong>. The long-term natural rate of interest, the effectiveness of fiscal redistribution, and the impact of monetary policy all look different once we acknowledge that not everyone is alike in the economy. By capturing how liquidity constraints and precautionary savings influence aggregate capital, this model provides guidance on questions like whether and how to tax wealth, and how aggressive monetary policy should be in, say, pushing interest rates to very low levels. Policymakers drawing on these insights might strive for a balance: ensuring there is enough aggregate saving for investment and growth, but not so much that it reflects unmet social insurance needs or creates financial imbalances.</p>

<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous investor beliefs combined with short-sale constraints can cause speculative bubbles, elevating asset prices above fundamental values.</li>
<li>Suggests improving market completeness and transparency to curb speculation and volatility <span class="citation" data-cites="harrison1978speculative">(<a href="#ref-harrison1978speculative" role="doc-biblioref">Harrison and Kreps 1978</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Harrison and Kreps (1978) model introduces a different kind of market imperfection into macro-finance: <strong>heterogeneous beliefs</strong> among investors, combined with constraints on short selling. Unlike the previous models (which focused on borrowing constraints and income risk), this model lives in the world of asset trading and speculation. Harrison and Kreps asked what happens in an asset market when investors have differing opinions about an asset’s value and they are not allowed to short sell the asset freely. Their answer was groundbreaking: even if all investors are rational (in that they update beliefs consistently with their own information), the mere diversity of opinion can lead to asset prices exceeding the valuation of even the most optimistic individual investor.</p>
<p>Here’s the intuition: suppose some investors (“optimists”) believe a stock or house will be very valuable in the future, while others (“pessimists”) believe it will not. If short selling is constrained (pessimists cannot easily borrow the asset to sell it short), the market price will be determined largely by the optimists’ willingness to pay. Now add the element of <strong>speculation</strong> – investors may buy an asset not just for its fundamental value (like dividends or rent) but also for the option to resell it in the future. Harrison &amp; Kreps showed that when beliefs differ, an investor might pay more than their own estimate of the asset’s fundamental value <strong>because they anticipate that someone even more optimistic might buy it at a higher price later</strong>. In effect, a <em>resale option</em> is priced in. This leads to what we might call a <strong>speculative premium</strong> on the asset price. The price can rise above the level that any single investor would pay if they had to hold the asset forever. In their words, the <em>right to resell</em> makes investors willing to pay more than the asset’s “hold-to-maturity” value. The inability of pessimists to short sell means nothing counteracts this upward pressure – the pessimists simply sit out of the market rather than actively pushing the price down by shorting. Thus, the market price reflects an <strong>over-optimistic valuation</strong>, driven by the most bullish views and the prospect of flipping the asset.</p>
<p>This mechanism helps explain phenomena like asset price bubbles or situations where market prices seem to detach from fundamental values. Real estate is a commonly cited example: investors might buy houses at high prices not only because they expect rising rents or income (fundamentals), but because they think they can later sell the house to someone else at an even higher price (speculation). If enough people believe housing prices will keep rising, and skeptics can’t effectively short the housing market, the result is a self-reinforcing price boom. The Harrison-Kreps model formalized how even <strong>fully rational agents with rational expectations (each given their own belief)</strong> can end up trading at prices that embed a speculative component. It doesn’t require irrational exuberance; it only requires disagreement and some friction (short-sale constraints) that prevents full arbitrage. In their equilibrium, everyone understands the price is above their own fundamental valuation, but they also know someone else might be willing to pay even more, so it can still be rational to buy now and plan to sell later – a clear parallel to the greater fool theory, but derived in a rigorous way.</p>
<p>Policy implications from the Harrison &amp; Kreps model revolve around <strong>financial market regulation and information disclosure</strong>. One implication is that short-selling constraints can fuel overpricing. If regulators make short selling too restrictive (perhaps in an attempt to curb volatility or prevent speculative attacks), they might inadvertently remove a balancing force that keeps prices close to fundamentals. The model would suggest that allowing more short selling (with proper oversight to avoid abuse) could actually lead to more informative, less one-sided pricing. Another implication is the value of <strong>transparency and common information</strong>. In the model, beliefs are heterogeneous and “dogmatic” – each trader sticks to their prior and interprets signals in their own way. If public information can help align beliefs (or at least inform the pessimists and optimists of each other’s views), it might reduce the degree of disagreement. However, complete agreement is unrealistic; differences in models, data interpretation, or risk appetite will always create some dispersion of opinion.</p>
<p>From a monetary policy perspective, one might not immediately see a connection, since H&amp;K is about asset pricing in a frictional financial market. But there are subtle links. Central banks today pay close attention to asset markets – housing, equities, etc. – because large deviations of asset prices from fundamentals can pose risks to financial stability and the broader economy. For instance, if low interest rates contribute to a speculative housing boom (by making borrowing cheap and encouraging optimistic beliefs about ongoing price growth), a subsequent crash could harm banks and consumers, leading to a recession. The H&amp;K model suggests that a booming asset market is not necessarily a sign of solid fundamentals; it could be a sign of constrained pessimism and resale-driven pricing. Policymakers, therefore, should be cautious in interpreting asset price signals. It also provides an argument for <strong>macroprudential policies</strong>: tools that directly address asset market excess (for example, tighter loan-to-value ratios in mortgage lending during a housing boom, or stricter margin requirements in stock trading). These can be seen as ways to mitigate the speculative dynamics – essentially pricking bubbles before they grow too large. By making it harder to purely speculate (through leverage restrictions) or by encouraging more two-sided markets (perhaps by permitting certain derivatives or short positions), regulators might reduce the likelihood of severe mispricings.</p>
<p>In summary, the Harrison &amp; Kreps model adds another layer to our understanding: market outcomes can be <strong>inefficient</strong> not just because of <strong>real-side</strong> frictions (like incomplete insurance) but also because of <strong>financial-side</strong> frictions (like trading constraints and belief dispersion). It is a reminder that even with rational actors, markets may need regulatory oversight to ensure they reflect true economic value. For a policymaker, being aware of this mechanism is important. It cautions against assuming that all investors have the same expectations (they don’t), and it illustrates why asset price booms can develop even without obvious irrationality. Recognizing a speculative bubble early is notoriously difficult, but understanding models like this helps officials appreciate the warning signs (e.g., when asset prices only make sense under very optimistic scenarios and buyers cite the ability to resell as justification). It also supports measures to improve market completeness – such as permitting more sophisticated financial instruments – because a more complete market (ability to hedge, to short, etc.) ironically may prevent the wild swings that incomplete markets allow.</p>

<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-implications-of-models"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Policy Implications of Models</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monetarism emphasizes stable, predictable policy frameworks.</li>
<li>Bewley and Aiyagari models highlight social insurance and targeted redistribution.</li>
<li>Harrison &amp; Kreps stress regulation of speculative financial markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each theoretical framework provides distinct policy insights for designing monetary and economic strategies. Key implications can be summarized clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Friedman/Monetarist (Complete Markets)</strong><br>
Monetarist models emphasize predictable and stable monetary policies. Temporary stimulus measures are ineffective since consumers respond mainly to permanent income changes. Monetary policy should thus follow clear, credible rules (e.g., a fixed money growth rate or inflation targeting), focusing on long-term price stability. Fiscal prudence is advised, as large deficits can be counterproductive due to anticipated future taxation (Ricardian equivalence). Ultimately, monetary policy should avoid attempts to permanently influence real variables like unemployment or income distribution directly, which are better addressed through structural and fiscal reforms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bewley (Incomplete Markets)</strong><br>
The Bewley model underscores the importance of social insurance and targeted redistribution. Because individuals face uninsurable risks and liquidity constraints, they maintain precautionary savings, limiting investment and consumption in downturns. Thus, policies providing social safety nets (unemployment insurance, healthcare, targeted stimulus payments) help stabilize aggregate demand and prevent severe economic downturns. Furthermore, targeted redistribution or improved credit access can mitigate inequality-driven demand shortfalls, addressing systemic underconsumption and secular stagnation risks. Effective policy involves balancing adequate insurance to stabilize demand without overly dampening incentives to work or save.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aiyagari (Incomplete Markets &amp; General Equilibrium)</strong><br>
Extending Bewley’s framework, Aiyagari emphasizes that precautionary saving leads to excessive capital accumulation and lower equilibrium interest rates. A crucial policy implication is that moderate capital income taxation, combined with redistribution, can improve overall welfare. Monetary policy, particularly interest-rate adjustments, significantly affects wealth distribution—low rates benefit borrowers (often younger or lower-wealth groups) at the expense of savers. Policymakers should therefore coordinate monetary and fiscal policies to achieve optimal capital allocation, moderate inequality, and promote balanced, sustainable economic growth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Harrison &amp; Kreps (Speculative Markets)</strong><br>
The Harrison &amp; Kreps model highlights the necessity of financial market regulation and transparency to address speculative bubbles driven by heterogeneous beliefs and short-sale constraints. Policy interventions should facilitate market completeness (e.g., by allowing regulated short selling or derivatives trading) and enforce transparency through robust disclosure standards. During speculative booms, targeted macroprudential tools (loan-to-value ratios, capital buffers) and proactive central-bank communication can mitigate bubbles without overly aggressive monetary tightening, thus integrating financial stability concerns effectively into monetary policy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a robust monetary policy approach integrates these perspectives, recognizing the importance of stable monetary frameworks, adequate social insurance, fiscal coordination, and prudent financial regulation. Successful policy practice involves using complementary tools (monetary, fiscal, regulatory) and adapting dynamically based on the interplay of inflation stability, wealth distribution, and financial stability. Historical experiences, such as the 2008 crisis and the COVID-19 response, illustrate the effectiveness of combining these insights into comprehensive, multidimensional policy strategies.</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridging-the-gap-between-theory-and-reality"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Reality</h2>
<p>Models should guide, not dictate, policy. No single model fully captures the complexity of real economies; thus, policymakers must integrate insights across multiple frameworks—complete markets, incomplete markets, and speculative dynamics—to design effective policies.</p>
<p>Real economies simultaneously involve heterogeneous agents, liquidity constraints, price rigidities, and speculative market behavior. Friedman’s monetarism emphasizes stable rules and credible expectations; Bewley and Aiyagari highlight liquidity constraints and precautionary savings; Harrison &amp; Kreps emphasize speculation driven by belief heterogeneity. Modern macroeconomic approaches increasingly integrate these elements (e.g., Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian models).</p>
<p>However, real-world policymaking faces challenges not fully accounted for by theory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expectations and Behavioral Factors:</strong> Individuals often deviate from rational expectations, resulting in behavioral biases and herd behaviors. Effective policy should therefore actively manage expectations through credible communication (forward guidance).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Political Economy and Credibility:</strong> Optimal theoretical policies may not align with political realities. Policymakers thus rely on robust frameworks—such as inflation targeting and automatic stabilizers—that remain effective even under delayed or politically compromised responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financial and Global Contexts:</strong> Traditional models underestimated financial sector impacts on policy effectiveness. Policymakers must explicitly account for banking sector stability and international capital flows in policy design.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, policymakers should stress-test policies using multiple models, employ targeted empirical approaches informed by microdata, and regularly update strategies based on observed outcomes. For instance, contrary to initial views, the monetary, fiscal, and financial-market policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic—particularly in the U.S.—highlight a failure of effective coordination, as evidenced by subsequent extreme wealth inequality and persistent inflation. Many experts criticize the lack of coherent policy integration, arguing it exacerbated economic distortions and reduced overall policy effectiveness.</p>
<p>In summary, bridging theory and reality requires flexible and empirically informed policy strategies, recognizing theoretical insights and practical limitations while ensuring effective coordination to mitigate unintended adverse outcomes.</p>

<p>Historical experience provides valuable tests for theoretical predictions, highlighting both successes and failures in policy implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Great Depression:</strong> Friedman and Schwartz demonstrated that monetary contraction deepened the Depression. The period validated the importance of maintaining stable aggregate demand and money supply, while illustrating risks of debt-deflation spirals. It emphasized roles for both monetary stabilization and fiscal intervention (e.g., New Deal, WWII spending), leading to institutional innovations like deposit insurance and lender-of-last-resort roles for central banks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Postwar Keynesian-Monetarist Debate &amp; Stagflation:</strong> The stagflation of the 1970s validated Friedman’s critique of simplistic Keynesian demand management and the natural rate hypothesis. Volcker’s aggressive monetary tightening demonstrated that inflation control requires credible commitment and acceptance of short-term economic pain. This period underscored the difficulty of targeting monetary aggregates directly, resulting in central banks shifting towards inflation targeting regimes with more flexible interest rate rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Great Moderation and 2008 Financial Crisis:</strong> The New Keynesian synthesis (price-stickiness, monetary rules, and representative agents) initially seemed successful during the Great Moderation, but failed to predict growing inequality and financial vulnerabilities that triggered the 2008 crisis. The crisis validated incomplete-market frameworks (Bewley/Aiyagari) and speculative asset-price models (Harrison-Kreps), highlighting the critical need to include financial frictions and heterogeneity in macroeconomic analysis. Quantitative easing stabilized financial markets, but disproportionately benefited wealthier asset holders, intensifying inequality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>COVID-19 Pandemic and Inflation Spike:</strong> The aggressive fiscal and monetary responses during COVID-19 prevented immediate economic collapse but led to persistent inflation and increased wealth inequality due to poor coordination and mis-targeted stimulus. In the U.S., particularly, stimulus measures lacked coherence, causing asset bubbles and skewed benefits to the wealthy. Current inflation challenges highlight monetarist concerns about excessive stimulus and underline the importance of coordinated fiscal-monetary policy frameworks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Key empirical lessons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Credible monetary policy frameworks</strong> that stabilize inflation are critical for long-run economic stability.</li>
<li><strong>Market imperfections (liquidity constraints, incomplete markets, financial fragility)</strong> significantly affect policy effectiveness and must be explicitly considered.</li>
<li><strong>Distributional issues matter:</strong> Monetary policy can inadvertently exacerbate inequality, stressing the need for complementary fiscal redistributive policies.</li>
<li><strong>Expectations and clear communication</strong> are essential for policy effectiveness, reinforcing the rational expectations perspective on policy transparency.</li>
</ol>
<p>In sum, successful policy in practice requires combining disciplined monetary frameworks, proactive management of market imperfections and inequalities, and flexibility to adapt based on evolving empirical evidence and economic conditions.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2" data-number="7">
<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Effective monetary policy requires a balance between long-run credibility and stability (as emphasized by neoclassical and monetarist models) and short-run interventions addressing market imperfections and inequality. Stable monetary frameworks—such as credible inflation targets and rule-based policies—anchor expectations, reduce uncertainty, and support sustainable economic growth. However, real economies exhibit significant market frictions, requiring complementary fiscal and regulatory interventions.</p>
<p>Incomplete-market models (Bewley, Aiyagari) highlight the necessity of policies that alleviate liquidity constraints and promote broader economic participation. Financial-market models (Harrison &amp; Kreps) stress the importance of regulatory vigilance to prevent speculative excesses. Recent empirical experiences—particularly the uncoordinated COVID-19 policy response in the U.S., which contributed to extreme wealth inequality and persistent inflation—underscore the risks of fragmented policy approaches.</p>
<p>The long-term orientation of neoclassical models also reminds us that <strong>economic growth and efficiency are paramount for raising living standards broadly</strong>. Sustainable reductions in wealth inequality are best achieved through <em>inclusive growth</em>—ensuring more people can participate in economic advancement via skill-building, access to capital, and productive investments. Policies that enhance <strong>productivity—education, infrastructure, and innovation—are crucial complements to monetary policy</strong>. While these are typically fiscal or structural measures, monetary policy plays a role by maintaining a <strong>low-inflation, stable macroeconomic backdrop</strong> and preventing the misallocation of capital into unproductive speculative ventures.</p>
<p>To mitigate wealth inequality without sacrificing efficiency, policymakers should consider measures such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Progressive taxation and wealth taxes</strong> to fund public goods and transfers efficiently (as Aiyagari’s framework suggests, moderate capital taxation can be welfare-enhancing).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Public investment in education, healthcare, and economic opportunity</strong> to foster broad-based growth and human capital development, reducing inequality over time.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging broad-based asset ownership</strong> through mechanisms like employee stock ownership plans or tax incentives for retirement savings, ensuring more households benefit from asset appreciation.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining low and stable inflation</strong> to protect real incomes, particularly for lower-income households who lack financial hedges against rising prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, the most effective policy approach integrates <strong>monetary stability, fiscal coordination, and regulatory prudence</strong> to foster inclusive, sustainable economic prosperity while ensuring that short-term interventions do not undermine long-term growth and efficiency.</p>

<p>Friedman’s Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) posits that an individual’s consumption at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is based on expected lifetime income rather than current income. The standard model assumes perfect capital markets, quadratic utility, and rational expectations.</p>
<p>Let the consumer’s lifetime utility function be: <span class="math display">\[
U = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the subjective discount factor and <span class="math inline">\(u(c_t)\)</span> is quadratic utility: <span class="math display">\[
u(c_t) = -\frac{1}{2} (c_t - c^*)^2.\]</span></p>
<p>The budget constraint is: <span class="math display">\[
A_{t+1} = (1+r)(A_t + Y_t - C_t),

Given rational expectations, Hall (1978) derived that optimal consumption follows a <strong>martingale process</strong>: <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> This implies that changes in consumption are unpredictable: <span class="math display">\[
E_t[c_{t+1} - c_t] = 0.

U = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t),
\]</span> subject to the budget constraint: <span class="math display">\[
A_{t+1} = (1+r)A_t + Y_t - C_t,
\]</span> and a borrowing constraint: <span class="math display">\[
A_t \geq 0.
\]</span> The income process follows a stochastic evolution: <span class="math display">\[
Y_t = Y_p + \varepsilon_t,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y_p\)</span> is the persistent component and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> is a transitory shock.</p>
<p>The Euler equation governs optimal consumption: <span class="math display">\[
E_t \left[ u'(c_t) \right] = \beta (1+r) E_t \left[ u'(c_{t+1}) \right].
\]</span> Binding borrowing constraints lead to higher marginal propensities to consume (MPC), distinguishing this model from the complete-market benchmark.</p>

<p>We calibrate the model using empirically relevant parameters:</p>

<p>Empirical evidence shows that wealth inequality observed in real economies is well captured by Bewley models. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S. Wealth Distribution:</strong> The model reproduces the fact that the top 10% of wealth holders own a disproportionately large share of total assets.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Credit Market Access:</strong> Relaxing borrowing constraints leads to higher consumption smoothing, reducing excess precautionary savings.</li>
<li><strong>Effects of Monetary Policy:</strong> Interest rate cuts primarily benefit liquidity-constrained households, increasing consumption, while wealthier agents respond weakly due to already accumulated assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model underscores the importance of credit access and social insurance policies to counteract excessive precautionary savings and stabilize aggregate demand.</p>

<h4 data-number="8.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theoretical-formulation-3"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.1</span> 1. Theoretical Formulation</h4>
<p>The Harrison &amp; Kreps (1978) model explores how heterogeneous beliefs among investors can lead to speculative bubbles in asset pricing. The key insight is that <strong>optimistic investors dominate the pricing mechanism when short-selling constraints exist</strong>, leading to equilibrium prices that can exceed fundamental values.</p>
<p>Consider a two-period model where investors have differing subjective probabilities about a risky asset’s payoff in period <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span>. The risky asset pays <span class="math inline">\(X_H\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> (optimists’ belief) and <span class="math inline">\(X_L\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(1 - p_H\)</span>. Similarly, pessimists believe the probabilities are <span class="math inline">\(p_L\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 - p_L\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p_H &gt; p_L\)</span>.</p>
<p>The price of the asset in period <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span> is determined by the highest bidder, given short-sale constraints: <span class="math display">\[
P_1 = \max\{ P_H, P_L \},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P_H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_L\)</span> are the optimists’ and pessimists’ valuation of the asset, respectively: <span class="math display">\[
P_H = \frac{p_H X_H + (1 - p_H) X_L}{1 + r}, \quad P_L = \frac{p_L X_H + (1 - p_L) X_L}{1 + r}.
\]</span> If short selling is not allowed, <strong>the price is set by the optimists</strong>, even if pessimists believe it to be overvalued.</p>
<p>In period <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span>, the true payoff <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is realized, and prices adjust accordingly: <span class="math display">\[
P_2 = X.
\]</span> If the optimists’ belief was overly optimistic, <strong>a crash occurs</strong>, showing that speculative bubbles arise due to heterogeneous expectations rather than fundamental mispricing alone.</p>

<section id="calibration-and-simulation-3" class="level4" data-number="8.4.2">
<h4 data-number="8.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calibration-and-simulation-3"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.2</span> 2. Calibration and Simulation</h4>
<p>To simulate this model, we set:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk-free rate:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.03\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Payoffs:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(X_H = 120\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_L = 80\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Beliefs:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(p_H = 0.8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_L = 0.5\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If <strong>short selling is restricted</strong>, the period-1 price reflects the optimists’ valuation: <span class="math display">\[
P_1 = \frac{0.8(120) + 0.2(80)}{1.03} = 97.09.
\]</span> If short selling is allowed, the pessimists’ valuation influences pricing: <span class="math display">\[
P_1 = \frac{0.5(120) + 0.5(80)}{1.03} = 97.09.
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Simulated Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(p_H\)</span> is too optimistic, <strong>asset prices rise above fundamentals</strong>, and when reality sets in at <span class="math inline">\(t=2\)</span>, prices drop, mimicking bubble dynamics.</li>
<li>If short-selling is unrestricted, <strong>prices better reflect fundamentals</strong>, reducing volatility.</li>
</ul>

<h4 data-number="8.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-analysis-speculative-bubbles-and-policy-implications"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.3</span> 3. Case Analysis: Speculative Bubbles and Policy Implications</h4>
<p>Empirical applications of the Harrison &amp; Kreps model highlight key cases of speculative booms and busts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dot-com Bubble (1999–2000):</strong> Investor optimism, combined with limited mechanisms for short-selling, led to massive overvaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Housing Market Crash (2008):</strong> Housing assets were driven by speculative demand and optimistic credit assessments; when reality hit, prices crashed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Policy takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Transparency:</strong> Improving information flow reduces belief dispersion, dampening bubbles.</li>
<li><strong>Short-Selling Mechanisms:</strong> Allowing short positions prevents excessive speculative premiums.</li>
<li><strong>Macroprudential Policies:</strong> Loan-to-value and capital requirements mitigate credit-fueled bubbles.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model underscores how <strong>heterogeneous beliefs and market constraints drive speculative price deviations</strong>, necessitating a balanced approach to financial regulation.</p>
