Mathematical Modelling

Objective: **Explain** the complex real-world system and **Predict** the future behavior of the system.

Process:
- **State** the Problem
	- **Clarify** the problem (5W1H): problem? why (objective)? who (observer)? where (area)? what (system)? when (dynamics)? how (criteria)? 
	- **Simplify** the problem: simplify the problem enough to make it mathematically tractable, by making critical assumptions and by naming and identifying the variables.
- **Formulate** the problem: express the problem in a systematic way.
- **Solve** the formulated problem : derive the mathematical conclusion
- **Interpret** the solved problem : derive the meaningful conclusion
- **Test** the conclusion by making a prediction
