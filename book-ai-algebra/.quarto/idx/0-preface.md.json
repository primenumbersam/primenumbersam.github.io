Eigenvectors represent directions that are only scaled by the transformation.\n-   **Python Visualization:** Visualizing eigenvectors (direction) and eigenvalues (magnitude of scaling) for a 2x2 matrix. Simulating the step-by-step application of a transition matrix (e.g., Lay's Markov chain example) and showing convergence to the eigenvector.\n-   **Interpretation Summary:** Eigenvectors reveal the fundamental directions or components of a linear transformation, and eigenvalues tell us the factor by which variance is scaled in those directions. This is key to understanding PCA.\n\n\n10 Finite-State Markov Chains : Google's PageRank\n- Steady-state vector\n-   **Famous Problem:** Solving very large systems of linear equations that arise from complex models or massive datasets (e.g., in finite element methods or network analysis). (Direct methods like Gaussian Elimination can be too slow or memory-intensive).\n-   **Key Assumptions:** Iterative methods approach the true solution Ax=b through successive approximations \\[Strang 7.4\\].\n-   **Python Visualization:** Implementing a simple iterative method (e.g., Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel, or gradient descent for Ax=b). Visualizing the convergence of the solution vector over iterations.\n-   **Interpretation Summary:** For very large problems, iterative methods provide a practical way to find approximate solutions to linear systems, essential in fields like numerical simulation and large-scale optimization (which underlies many machine learning algorithms).\n\n7 Symmetric matrices and Quadratic Forms : Multichannel Image Processing\n- SVD\n\n-   **Famous Problem:** Analyzing the spread and correlation within a dataset, represented by the covariance matrix.\n-   **Key Assumptions:** The covariance matrix is symmetric and (often) positive semidefinite or positive definite. Its eigenvectors point in directions of maximum variance (principal components).\n-   **Python Visualization:** Calculating the covariance matrix for a 2D/3D dataset using `numpy.cov`. Visualizing the data scatter plot. Overlaying the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix scaled by the eigenvalues to show the principal axes of variance (linking back to Unit 2.1/2.2).\n-   **Interpretation Summary:** The covariance matrix summarizes feature relationships. Positive definiteness is a key property related to variance and optimization objectives. Eigenanalysis of the covariance matrix reveals the principal components.\n\nDimensionality Reduction & Data Compression: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n- Famous Problem: Image compression or reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most information (Principal Component Analysis).\n- Key Assumptions: Any matrix can be decomposed into a product of three matrices (U, Σ, V^T). The singular values in Σ capture the \"importance\" of each dimension.\n- Python Visualization: Performing SVD on a simple data matrix or grayscale image using numpy.linalg.svd. Showing the singular values. Reconstructing the matrix/image using only the top k singular values and vectors, visualizing the compressed result. Illustrating the four fundamental subspaces using SVD.\n- Interpretation Summary: SVD provides a powerful way to understand a matrix's structure, identify its rank, find orthogonal bases for the fundamental subspaces, and approximate the matrix with lower rank, directly enabling techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Applied Linear Algebra: Practical Modules**\n\n- 9 Linear Programming **Optimization and Linear Programming**  \n      Linear inequality problems in economics, resource allocation, and engineering  \n      • Duality and economic interpretation\n    \n- 8 **Geometric Structures of Linear Spaces**  \n      Visualizing algebra through Platonic solids and polytopes  \n      • Foundations of convexity and feasibility\n    \n- 1 **Linear Equations**  \n      Economic input-output analysis and physical system simulations  \n      • Business, Science, and Engineering applications\n    \n- 2 **Matrix Algebra in Computation and Graphics**  \n      How matrices govern structural transformations  \n      • Leontief Model and Computer-Aided Design\n    \n- 3 **Determinants and Volume-Based Intuition**  \n      Orientation, distortion, and random paths in multi-dimensional spaces  \n      • From row operations to volume calculation\n    \n- 4 **Linear Spaces**  \n      Abstract structure behind control systems and recursive dynamics  \n      • Rank-Nullity Theorem  \n      • **Difference** equations and Markov chains\n    \n- 5 **Eigenvectors in Dynamical Systems**  \n      Growth, decay, and stability in nature and engineering  \n      • **Differential** equations and population models\n    \n- 10 **Finite-State Markov Chains and PageRank**  \n      How Google ranks the internet using steady-state vectors\n    \n- 6 **Orthogonality and Least Squares**  \n      From projections to GPS: minimizing errors in systems\n    \n- 7 **Symmetric Matrices and Quadratic Forms**  \n      Multichannel image processing and data compression  \n      • Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n    \n---\n\nMathematical Modelling\n\nObjective: **Explain** the complex real-world system and **Predict** the future behavior of the system.\n\nProcess:\n- **State** the Problem\n\t- **Clarify** the problem (5W1H): problem? why (objective)? who (observer)? where (area)? what (system)? when (dynamics)? how (criteria)? \n\t- **Simplify** the problem: simplify the problem enough to make it mathematically tractable, by making critical assumptions and by naming and identifying the variables.\n- **Formulate** the problem: express the problem in a systematic way.\n- **Solve** the formulated problem : derive the mathematical conclusion\n- **Interpret** the solved problem : derive the meaningful conclusion\n- **Test** the conclusion by making a prediction\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Prologue\n\nLet us not fall into the error of personifying objects.\n**People are subjects; mathematics is a tool.**\n\nWe do not learn mathematics because it speaks to us,\nbut because **it helps us express our own questions more beautifully and precisely**.\n\nThis book is not about solving someone else’s problems.\nIt is about discovering **how to express your own questions**—clearly, honestly, and elegantly—through the language of mathematics.\n\n## Contents\n\n> 수학의 자기 완결성?
