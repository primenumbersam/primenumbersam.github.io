(Similar to the introductory systems in Lay).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Data can be represented as vectors in Rn. Relationships between data points or variables can be modeled by linear equations.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Plotting 2D/3D vectors. Visualizing lines and planes from simple equations. Showing the intersection point/line as the solution.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** How vectors capture multi-dimensional data, and how systems of equations represent constraints or relationships between features/variables.\n\n### Unit 1.2: Solving Systems: Gaussian Elimination and Matrix Operations\n*   **Famous Problem:** Solving for coefficients in a simple polynomial fitting problem (e.g., fitting a line or parabola to a few exact points). This leads to an Ax=b problem.\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The system Ax=b has a unique solution, infinite solutions, or no solution. Gaussian Elimination is a systematic way to transform the system.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Illustrating row operations on an augmented matrix. Showing the matrix A, vector b, and solving using `numpy.linalg.solve`. Visualizing the result (e.g., the fitted polynomial).\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** Understanding matrix A as representing the structure of the problem, x as the unknown parameters (e.g., coefficients), and b as the observed data. Gaussian Elimination finds x. Introduction of matrix operations like multiplication (relevant for Ax=b).\n\n### Unit 1.3: The Geometry of Solution Spaces: Vector Spaces and Subspaces\n*   **Famous Problem:** Understanding the set of all possible outputs of a linear model, or the set of inputs that result in zero output (null space).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Data and results live within vector spaces. Subspaces represent important subsets (like the column space or null space of a matrix).\n*   **Python Visualization:** Visualizing the span of vectors in 2D/3D (showing subspaces). Illustrating column space (image) and null space (kernel) for simple matrices.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** Connecting the column space of A to the possible values of Ax=b and the null space of A to the non-uniqueness of solutions. Introduction of concepts like basis and dimension.\n\n### Unit 1.4: Data Transformations: Linear Transformations and Matrices\n*   **Famous Problem:** Applying geometric transformations (scaling, rotation, shear) to data points or images. (Examples of transformations are in Lay).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Linear transformations preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication. Every linear transformation can be represented by a matrix.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Applying transformation matrices to sets of 2D points (e.g., a square or a face) and visualizing the result. Visualizing 3D transformations if possible.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** Understanding how matrices can linearly transform data, which is fundamental to neural networks and many other models.\n\n## Part 2: Analyzing Data Structure (Unsupervised Learning)\n\n### Unit 2.1: Capturing Variance and Directions: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n*   **Famous Problem:** Analyzing the long-term behavior of a system or process, like population distribution changes or Markov chains. (Eigenvectors show stable states).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The matrix A represents the transition or transformation rules of the system. Eigenvectors represent directions that are only scaled by the transformation.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Visualizing eigenvectors (direction) and eigenvalues (magnitude of scaling) for a 2x2 matrix. Simulating the step-by-step application of a transition matrix (e.g., Lay's Markov chain example) and showing convergence to the eigenvector.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** Eigenvectors reveal the fundamental directions or components of a linear transformation, and eigenvalues tell us the factor by which variance is scaled in those directions. This is key to understanding PCA.\n\n### Unit 2.2: Dimensionality Reduction & Data Compression: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n*   **Famous Problem:** Image compression or reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most information (Principal Component Analysis).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Any matrix can be decomposed into a product of three matrices (U, Σ, V^T). The singular values in Σ capture the \"importance\" of each dimension.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Performing SVD on a simple data matrix or grayscale image using `numpy.linalg.svd`. Showing the singular values. Reconstructing the matrix/image using only the top k singular values and vectors, visualizing the compressed result. Illustrating the four fundamental subspaces using SVD.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** SVD provides a powerful way to understand a matrix's structure, identify its rank, find orthogonal bases for the fundamental subspaces, and approximate the matrix with lower rank, directly enabling techniques like PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n\n### Unit 2.3: Data Relationships: Covariance and Positive Definite Matrices\n*   **Famous Problem:** Analyzing the spread and correlation within a dataset, represented by the covariance matrix.\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The covariance matrix is symmetric and (often) positive semidefinite or positive definite. Its eigenvectors point in directions of maximum variance (principal components).\n*   **Python Visualization:** Calculating the covariance matrix for a 2D/3D dataset using `numpy.cov`. Visualizing the data scatter plot. Overlaying the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix scaled by the eigenvalues to show the principal axes of variance (linking back to Unit 2.1/2.2).\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** The covariance matrix summarizes feature relationships. Positive definiteness is a key property related to variance and optimization objectives. Eigenanalysis of the covariance matrix reveals the principal components.\n\n## Part 3: Modeling Data Relationships (Supervised Learning)\n\n### Unit 3.1: Finding the Best Fit: Projections and Least Squares\n*   **Famous Problem:** Linear Regression: Finding the line (or plane) that best fits a set of data points. (The data points b are not exactly in the column space of A, so Ax=b is unsolvable).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** The \"best fit\" line/plane is the orthogonal projection of the data vector b onto the column space of the design matrix A. The error vector is orthogonal to the column space.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Plotting 2D data points (t, b). Visualizing the design matrix A and data vector b setup for linear regression. Calculating the projection p = Ax̂ using the normal equations (ATAx̂ = ATb). Plotting the resulting \"best fit\" line y = C + Dt. Visualizing the error vectors (b-p) as orthogonal to the column space of A.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** Least squares provides a standard method to find model parameters when an exact solution doesn't exist, minimizing the sum of squared errors. This is achieved by projecting the observed data onto the model's prediction space. Orthogonality is the key geometric principle.\n\n### Unit 3.2: Orthogonal Bases and Projections Revisited\n*   **Famous Problem:** Improving numerical stability or simplifying calculations in linear models.\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Orthogonal bases simplify projection calculations. The Gram-Schmidt process can find an orthogonal basis.\n*   **Python Visualization:** Demonstrating the Gram-Schmidt process on a set of linearly independent vectors and visualizing the resulting orthogonal vectors. Comparing the ease of calculating a projection onto a subspace using a standard basis vs. an orthogonal basis.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** Orthogonal bases provide a computationally advantageous way to represent vector spaces and perform projections, improving the reliability of algorithms in practice.\n\n### Unit 3.3: Solving Large Systems: Iterative Methods\n*   **Famous Problem:** Solving very large systems of linear equations that arise from complex models or massive datasets (e.g., in finite element methods or network analysis). (Direct methods like Gaussian Elimination can be too slow or memory-intensive).\n*   **Key Assumptions:** Iterative methods approach the true solution Ax=b through successive approximations [Strang 7.4].\n*   **Python Visualization:** Implementing a simple iterative method (e.g., Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel, or gradient descent for Ax=b). Visualizing the convergence of the solution vector over iterations.\n*   **Interpretation Summary:** For very large problems, iterative methods provide a practical way to find approximate solutions to linear systems, essential in fields like numerical simulation and large-scale optimization (which underlies many machine learning algorithms).\n\n## Conclusion: Where to Go Next\n*   Briefly discuss
