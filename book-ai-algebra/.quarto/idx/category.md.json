{"title":"\"Different expressions, same meaning.\"","markdown":{"headingText":"\"Different expressions, same meaning.\"","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nTerminology and Notations\n\n- Adjoint functor\n- Hasse Diagram : Partially ordered set (poset)\n- Commutative Diagram\n\n\nCategory theory is a language for comparing different forms of expression to identify structures that are essentially the same. It extends set theory through functional thinking and abstraction, focusing on **relationships and composition** rather than individual elements. For instance, rather than treating **equality** (`=`) as the central notion, category theory replaces it with a more flexible concept: **equivalence**.\n\n* **Isomorphism** means two objects are completely identical in structure — there exists a one-to-one and onto functor with an inverse.\n* **Equivalence** means two categories may look different, but their essential behavior is indistinguishable.\n\nIf a functor $F : \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ is **full**, **faithful**, and **essentially surjective**, then $\\mathcal{C} \\simeq \\mathcal{D}$. In other words, the two categories are **the same in meaning**, though different in appearance.\n\n| Categorical Property   | Set-Theoretic Analogy                | Interpretation                                  |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Full                   | Surjective on morphisms              | Preserves **all relationships**                 |\n| Faithful               | Injective on morphisms               | **Precisely distinguishes** relationships       |\n| Essentially Surjective | Up to isomorphism, everything is hit | Captures the **existential meaning** of objects |\n\n\n### Objects and Relationships\n\nIn category theory:\n\n* **Objects** can be interpreted as **source** and **target**, often thought of as **nodes** in a diagram.\n* **Morphisms** (or arrows) describe **relationships** between objects.\n* A **functor** maps one category to another, preserving identity morphisms and composition of morphisms.\n* A **category** is a collection of objects and morphisms satisfying associativity and identity laws.\n\n\n### Equivalence of Categories\n\nThe statement “Two categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ are equivalent” means:\n\nThere exist two functors $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}, \\quad G: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ such that $G F \\cong \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{C}}, \\quad F G \\cong \\mathrm{id}_{\\mathcal{D}}$\n\n**Example:**\nThe category of finite-dimensional real vector spaces and the category of real vector spaces with a fixed basis are equivalent, even though one emphasizes linear maps and the other emphasizes coordinate representations.\n\n\n### Dual of a Category\n\nFor any category $\\mathcal{C}$, its **dual category** $\\mathcal{C}^{\\mathrm{op}}$ is defined by reversing the direction of **all** morphisms: Every morphism $f: A \\to B$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ becomes $f^{\\mathrm{op}}: B \\to A$ in $\\mathcal{C}^{\\mathrm{op}}$.\n\n**Example:**\nIn the category **Pos** of partially ordered sets, the dual category corresponds to reversing the order. That is, $(P, \\le)$ becomes $(P, \\ge)$.\n\n### Dually Equivalent Categories\n\nThe statement “Two categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ are dually equivalent” means\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} \\simeq \\mathcal{D}^{\\mathrm{op}}\n\\quad\\text{or equivalently}\\quad\n\\mathcal{C}^{\\mathrm{op}} \\simeq \\mathcal{D}.\n$$\n\n**Example:**\nThe category of affine schemes **Aff** is dually equivalent to the category of commutative rings **CRing**:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Aff} \\simeq \\mathbf{CRing}^{\\mathrm{op}}.\n$$\n\nThis reflects how **geometric** objects correspond contravariantly to **algebraic** objects — a core insight of algebraic geometry.\n\n\n### Self-dual Category\n\nSelf-duality is a special case of dual equivalence:\n\n$$\n\\text{self-duality} \\;\\subset\\; \\text{dual equivalence}.\n$$\n\nA category $\\mathcal{C}$ is **self-dual** if it is equivalent to its own dual:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} \\simeq \\mathcal{C}^{\\mathrm{op}}.\n$$\n\n**Example:**\nThe category **FdVectₙ** of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field is self-dual, because every linear space is naturally isomorphic to its dual via the Riesz representation theorem. Another example is the category of Boolean algebras **Bool**, which is self-dual through negation and De Morgan’s laws.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"category.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
