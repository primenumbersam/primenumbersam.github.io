sufficient quantity, a **combination of foods** is required to maintain **homeostasis**.\nThis motivates the question:\n\n> How can we combine available foods to satisfy minimum daily nutritional requirements?\n\nThe goal of this section is to **translate a biological constraint** into a **system of linear equations**, and to analyze the feasibility of different cases:\n\n* exactly determined system\n* overdetermined system\n* underdetermined system\n\n### What Is an Organism?\n\nThe term *organism* refers to a living system—often characterized by metabolic activity, internal regulation, and structural complexity.\nFrom a **reductionist** perspective, however, an organism can be seen as a system composed mostly of just a few atomic elements:\n**carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N).**\nThese are the backbone of what we classify as **organic molecules**, in contrast to **inorganic** substances, which are not primarily composed of C, H, O, or N.\n\nThat said, the line between “organic” and “inorganic” is not absolute—it is a **gray area**, defined not by nature itself, but through **human standardization** and consensus.\n\n### What Is a Nutrient?\n\nFrom the perspective of molecular chemistry, nutrients are molecules made of atoms bonded together—typically through covalent or ionic bonds.\nMajor categories of nutrients include:\n\n* **Fat (fatty acids)**: carbon–hydrogen chains with a carboxylic group (COOH)\n* **Carbohydrates**: molecules composed mainly of C, H, and O\n* **Proteins**: nitrogen-containing compounds linked by peptide bonds\n* **Minerals**: micronutrients not based on C–H–O–N, often including ions like Fe²⁺, Ca²⁺, Zn²⁺\n\nWe assume here that to sustain life, a person must consume **a fixed minimum amount (in grams)** of each nutrient per day—say, for example, one unit of **fat, carbohydrate, protein, and mineral**.\n\n\n## Case 1: Exactly Determined System\n\nSuppose a person can choose from exactly **4 foods**: Bread, Potato, Steak, and Salad.\nLet each food contribute a known amount of each of the 4 nutrients per 100g.\nIf the daily nutritional requirement is known and fixed, the question becomes:\n\n> Can we find exactly **one solution**—one fixed combination of food quantities—to meet the nutrient requirements?\n\nThis is a **square system**:\n\n* 4 variables (food quantities)\n* 4 equations (nutrient requirements)\n  If the nutrient matrix is invertible, a **unique solution** exists.\n  In this case, the person **must** eat precisely that fixed combination every day.\n\n\n## Case 2: Overdetermined System\n\nNow suppose an additional food is available—**Sandwich**.\nThere are now **5 food options**, but still only 4 nutrient constraints.\n\nThis leads to an **overdetermined system**:\n\n* 5 variables\n* 4 equations\n\nNow there are **infinitely many possible food combinations** that can satisfy the nutritional goal.\nThe system may still have a solution if the extra food doesn't conflict with the requirements.\nIt is **flexible**, allowing for choice, taste, and substitution.\n\n\n## Case 3: Underdetermined System\n\nSuppose only **2 foods** are available—Bread and Potato.\n\nNow we have:\n\n* 2 variables\n* 4 equations\n\nThis is an **underdetermined system**.\nIt is **impossible** to satisfy all nutrient constraints using only two foods, unless by some coincidence the two foods form a spanning set for the nutritional space.\nIn general, no combination of these two foods alone will meet the minimum nutrient requirements.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis simple biological system illustrates the essence of **linear systems of equations**:\n\n* Whether a solution exists depends on the **relationship between equations and unknowns**.\n* Whether the solution is **unique** or **nonexistent** can often be deduced from matrix structure alone.\n\nBy modeling a nutritional constraint as a matrix equation, we move from **biology to algebra**, and gain insight into what is possible, impossible, or flexible in real-world systems.\n\n## 2D Coordinate Geometry\n\nTo further simplify the discussion of the three types of linear systems introduced above, we visualize each case in a two-dimensional coordinate system.\n\n* In the first plot (**Exactly Determined**), two lines intersect at a single point, representing a unique solution.\n* In the second plot (**Overdetermined**), three lines may not all intersect at a single point, but may approximate a common intersection — a solution may exist, but only under specific consistency conditions.\n* In the third plot (**Underdetermined**), only one line is present, representing infinitely many solutions along the line.\n\n```{python}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Setup
