Drawing from the ecological foundations of Lotka–Volterra systems and their reinterpretation in Goodwin-type class dynamics, we estimate time-varying parameters using U.S. wealth share data from 1989 to 2024. The empirical analysis reveals a persistent erosion of labor's structural role, not only among the general population but also within the most capital-intensive strata. A calibrated system with minimally positive transmission from labor to capital is sufficient to sustain realistic long-run dynamics, while full disconnection leads to terminal decay of capital itself. These results challenge conventional interpretations of equilibrium and redistribution, suggesting that economic survival is less about moral desert and more about positional geometry. The study concludes by proposing a normative framework for economic system design, where structural resilience and ethical intervention are understood as functions of dynamic curvature.","keywords":"automation, wealth inequality, nonlinear dynamics, capital-labor relations, replicator systems, predator-prey models, economic design, structural exclusion, endogenous stability","format":{"html":{"code-fold":true,"toc":true}},"bibliography":"d_references.bib"},"headingText":"Labor-Capital Dynamics in the Age of Automation","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Introduces a nonlinear dynamical model where capital can persist or collapse depending on minimal structural links to labor, calibrated on U.S. top-percentile wealth share data (1989–2024).\n\n- Shows that automation-led capital growth, without sufficient labor coupling, leads to systemic extinction—even for elite capital holders—revealing a degenerate equilibrium regime.\n\n- Reinterprets economic equilibrium not as a sign of fairness or efficiency, but as a geometric endpoint of exclusion, calling for ethical intervention based on structural curvature.\n\n\n## Contents\n\n1.
