The results emphasize the importance of considering underlying economic disparities when evaluating the fairness and effectiveness of qualification standards in society.\n\n## Main\n\n### Model Scenario\n\nIn short, we consider a society divided into two distinct classes:\n\n- **Proletariat (P)**: Individuals with access to general opportunities.\n- **Capitalist (C)**: Individuals with access to both general and exclusive special opportunities.\n\nInternally, both classes operate within perfectly competitive markets that adhere to the no-arbitrage principle. However, due to capital constraints, members of the P class cannot access the special opportunities available to the C class, rendering these opportunities unattainable. Consequently, while the absolute value of special opportunities is equal to or greater than that of general opportunities, the P class cannot exploit potential arbitrage opportunities due to these constraints. Both classes have offspring who inherit the economic outcomes of their parents' investments. To claim these inherited assets, all offspring must meet a minimum qualification standard (e.g., educational credentials), analogous to the strike price ($K$) in option pricing. Until this qualification is met, the offspring hold a call option on their parents' assets.\n\nIn detail, consider two distinct social classes: the proletariat (P), representing working-class individuals, and the capitalist class (C), representing wealthy individuals. These two classes face fundamentally different opportunity sets due to deep-seated structural inequalities. Such societal barriers, from both democratic and utilitarian viewpoints, constitute a significant social inefficiency.\n\nTo analyze the structural origins of this inefficiency, we apply the concept of **Limits to Arbitrage Theory**, which suggests markets are not always fully efficient. This inefficiency arises because of various constraints, such as behavioral biases, risk constraints, and notably, capital constraints. Capital constraints imply that significant capital is required to engage in arbitrage, effectively isolating classes economically. We assume, therefore, that the proletariat and capitalist classes are economically segregated due to these capital constraints.\n\nWithin each class, economic opportunities exist in a perfectly competitive market, satisfying the no-arbitrage condition internally. Members of the proletariat (P) freely select from a common set of general opportunities available to them. Conversely, members of the capitalist class (C) not only share these general opportunities but also exclusively access additional \"special opportunities.\" From the viewpoint of proletariat class members, these special opportunities represent unattainable benefits (\"grapes beyond reach\"), carrying higher or equal absolute value compared to general opportunities.\n\nTheoretically, if members of the capitalist class could short-sell general opportunities and simultaneously long-position special opportunities, they could realize arbitrage profits. However, due to aforementioned capital constraints (\"limits to arbitrage\"), such arbitrage trading is practically impossible within this model.\n\nBoth classes have offspring who inherit the economic results (absolute asset values) of their parents' investment choices. To claim these inherited assets, children from both classes must meet identical minimum qualification standards (e.g., university diplomas, basic educational credentials). Although the qualification standard is identical for both, outcomes differ significantly due to inherited assets. For instance, a business administration graduate from the capitalist class inherits and manages substantial capital (businesses), while an identically qualified individual from the proletariat class works as an employee, earning wages in capitalist-owned enterprises.\n\nThe minimum qualification standard can be understood as a fixed barrier or strike price (K) of a **call option**. Until the qualification requirement is fulfilled, the children effectively hold call options on their parents' assets. This model aims to quantify the absolute value of these call options for each class, reflecting the inherited economic outcomes accessible to the offspring.\n\n### EMM-based Call Option Valuation Theory\n\nAssume a simple 1 period setting with only two possible states (e.g. good or bad). Under the Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM), the fair market value of a call option at time 0, denoted as $\\hat{f}_0$, must satisfy:\n\n$$\\hat{f_0}\\cdot R = E^q[f_1]$$ where $f_1=max(S_0 \\cdot U-K,0)$\n\n$$S_0\\cdot R=E^q[S_1]$$ where $S_0$ = the current price of risky underlying asset\n\nFrom these two equations, we have the EMM or the state price density for good state $q$ as:\n$$\nq = \\frac{R - D}{U - D}\n$$\n\nThus, the present fair value of the call option is given by:\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}_0 = \\frac{1}{R}\\left[ \\frac{R - D}{U - D}(S_0 \\cdot U - K) + \\frac{U - R}{U - D} \\cdot 0 \\right] = \\frac{(R - D)(U - 1)}{R(U - D)}\n$$\n\nassuming that  \n\n* Initial Asset Price (normalized): $S_0=1$  \n* Strike Price (qualification threshold): $K=1$  \n* Maturity: 18 years (quarterly steps = 72 periods)  \n\nThis formula indicates a clear proportional relationship for estimating current fair values representing inherited qualification-based claims for each class over a 18-year maturity period. While this valuation could be approximated using continuous distributions (e.g., Black-Scholes under symmetric assumptions $U \\cdot D=1$), our discrete binomial model allows straightforward interpretation without loss of economic intuition.\n\n### Empirical Analysis\n\nWe employ distinct underlying assets for each class. Using the historical dataset (Q1 1982–Q4 2019, 152 quarterly observations), we estimated the parameters and their associated fair values of call options for each class.\n\n**For Proletariat (P) Class Children:**  \n\n* **Risky Asset**: US Median usual weekly Real earnings (LES1252881600Q)  \n* **Risk-Free Asset**: US Real GDP per capita (A939RX0Q048SBEA)  \n* Parameters:  \n  - $U_p$:= 75th percentile growth of wage (risky asset)  \n  - $D_p$:= 25th percentile growth of wage  \n  - $R_p$:= Median growth rate of Real GDP per capita\n\n**For Capitalist (C) Class Children:**  \n\n* **Risky Asset**: S&P 500 equity (SPX)  \n* **Risk-Free Asset**: US 10-Year Treasury Bond\n* Parameters:  \n  - $U_c$:= 75th percentile quarterly growth of the equity index  \n  - $D_c$:= 25th percentile quarterly growth of the equity index  \n  - $R_c$:= Median of quarterly US 10-Year Treasury Bond Yield (DGS10)\n\n**Empirical Results:**\n\n* **For Proletariat (P) class children**, $\\hat{P}_0=?$  \n* **For Capitalist (C) class children**, $\\hat{C}_0=?$  \n\n```{python}\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas_datareader.data as web\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 데이터 기간 설정\nstart_date = '1982-01-01'\nend_date = '2019-12-31'\n\n# S&P 500 데이터 가져오기\nsp500 = yf.download(\"^GSPC\", start=start_date, end=end_date, interval=\"1d\")\nsp500_q = sp500['Close'].resample('QE').last()  # 분기별 종가 데이터\n\n# FRED 데이터 가져오기\nus_median_weekly_earnings = web.DataReader('LES1252881600Q', 'fred', start_date, end_date)\nus_real_gdp_per_capita = web.DataReader('A939RX0Q048SBEA', 'fred', start_date, end_date)\nus_10yr_treasury_yield = web.DataReader('DGS10', 'fred', start_date, end_date)\n\n# 인덱스를 맞추기 위해 분기별로 재샘플링\nus_median_weekly_earnings = us_median_weekly_earnings.resample('QE').last()\nus_real_gdp_per_capita = us_real_gdp_per_capita.resample('QE').last()\nus_10yr_treasury_yield = us_10yr_treasury_yield.resample('QE').last()\n\n# 데이터프레임으로 변환\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'SP500': sp500_q.squeeze(),\n    'Median_Weekly_Earnings': us_median_weekly_earnings['LES1252881600Q'].squeeze(),\n    'Real_GDP_per_Capita': us_real_gdp_per_capita['A939RX0Q048SBEA'].squeeze(),\n    '10yr_Treasury_Yield': us_10yr_treasury_yield['DGS10'].squeeze()\n}, index=sp500_q.index)\n\n# 결측값 제거\ndata.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n# 수익률 계산\ndata['SP500_Return'] = data['SP500'].pct_change()\ndata['Earnings_Growth'] = data['Median_Weekly_Earnings'].pct_change()\ndata['GDP_Growth'] = data['Real_GDP_per_Capita'].pct_change()\n\n# 통계치 계산\nU_p = data['Earnings_Growth'].quantile(0.75)+1\nD_p = data['Earnings_Growth'].quantile(0.25)+1\nR_p = data['GDP_Growth'].median()+1\n\nU_c = data['SP500_Return'].quantile(0.75)+1\nD_c = data['SP500_Return'].quantile(0.25)+1\nR_c = data['10yr_Treasury_Yield'].median()\nR_c = R_c / 100 +1\n\nprint(f\"Proletariat Class Children Parameters:\")\nprint(f\"U_p: {U_p:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"D_p: {D_p:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"R_p: {R_p:.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nCapitalist Class Children Parameters:\")\nprint(f\"U_c: {U_c:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"D_c: {D_c:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"R_c: {R_c:.2f}\")\n\n\n# Binomial Option Pricing Model\ndef binomial_option_pricing(K, S_0, T, U, D, R, dt):\n    \"\"\"\n    K: Strike price\n    S_0: Initial stock price\n    T: Time to maturity (in years)\n    U: Up factor\n    D: Down factor\n    R: Risk-free rate\n    dt: Number of steps for each year\n    \"\"\"\n    n = T*dt # Number of steps in the binomial tree\n    q = (R - D) / (U - D)\n\n    # Initialize option values at maturity\n    option_values = np.zeros((n + 1, 1))\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        ST = S_0 * (U ** i) * (D ** (n - i))\n        option_values[i] = max(0, ST - K)\n\n    # Backward recursion for option values\n    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        for i in range(j + 1):\n            option_values[i] = (q * option_values[i + 1] + (1 - q) * option_values[i]) / R\n\n    return option_values[0, 0]\n\n\n# Parameters\nK = 1  # Strike price\nS_0 = 1  # Initial stock price\nT = 18  # Time to maturity (18 years)\ndt = 4 # Number of steps for each year\n\n# Calculate option prices\noption_price_proletariat = binomial_option_pricing(K, S_0, T, U_p, D_p, R_p, dt)\noption_price_capitalist = binomial_option_pricing(K, S_0, T, U_c, D_c, R_c, dt)\n\nprint(f\"\\nFair price of Call Option, held by Proletariat Class Children:\\n {option_price_proletariat:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Fair price of Call Option, held by Capitalist Class Children:\\n {option_price_capitalist:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Discussion\n\nThis model clarifies the stark inequality underlying \"ostensibly equal\" qualification standards.

Our model complements this literature by quantitatively evaluating how these structural factors systematically influence the absolute value of identical qualification standards across distinct socioeconomic groups.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"pricing_equal.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

to structural societal inequalities, hold different absolute values for distinct social classes. By applying the Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM) approach within the framework of rational asset pricing theory, we analyze how capital constraints and limits to arbitrage perpetuate inefficiencies in opportunity valuation between the proletariat and capitalist classes.","bibliography":["pricing_equal.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}},"projectFormats":["html"]}
