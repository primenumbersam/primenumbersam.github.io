The classical **Lotka–Volterra equations** describe their nonlinear dynamics as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x} &= x(a_{11} - a_{12} y), \\\\\n\\dot{y} &= y(a_{21} x - a_{22}),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere all parameters $a_{ij} > 0$ represent positive interaction or decay rates. This defines a closed, two-dimensional autonomous system on the positive orthant $\\mathbb{R}_+^2$.\n\nThere are no external shocks, migrations, or species mutations—only endogenous interaction between predator and prey. The predator grows by consuming the prey; the prey reproduces in the absence of predation.\n\nThis system exhibits a distinctive dynamical feature: **closed orbits** in the phase plane. That is, solutions cycle indefinitely without converging to a fixed point or diverging to infinity. This reflects the conservative nature of the system—total “interaction energy” is preserved, and the system perpetually oscillates.\n\n> **Mathematical Insight:** These closed cycles correspond, in the frequency domain, to dominant harmonic modes—i.e., a natural periodicity. From a systems-theoretic perspective, this allows interpretation via **Fourier decomposition**, where the cyclical behavior of populations maps to periodic oscillators in signal processing.\n\nThus, the Lotka–Volterra model offers a rich entry point for understanding **non-equilibrium dynamics**, **nonlinear feedback**, and **structural cycles**—core features of many biological and economic systems.\n\n```{python}\n# Simulation Plan\n# 1.

But in **closed systems**, equilibrium should not be mistaken for a “rest state” reflecting optimality or efficiency. Instead, it emerges as a **structural attractor**—a state selected by internal constraints and interaction geometry. It may arise without innovation, adaptation, or optimal design. It is not necessarily **best**; it is simply **allowed** by the rules of the system.\n\nWe formalize a dynamical system on a smooth state space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as:\n\n> **Definition (Autonomous System):**  \n> An autonomous dynamical system is a pair $(\\mathbb{R}^n, f)$, where $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a continuously differentiable vector field. The evolution of state $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ is governed by:\n> $$\n> \\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = f(\\mathbf{x}), \\quad \\mathbf{x}(0) = \\mathbf{x}_0.\n> $$\n\nHere, the function $f$ captures the internal feedback structure—how the system updates itself from one moment to the next. The system is **autonomous** if $f$ is time-invariant, and **closed** if it excludes any external forcing or dimensional change.\n\n> **Assumption 1 (Autonomy):**  \n> The dynamics do not depend explicitly on time: $\\partial f / \\partial t = 0$. This preserves structural invariance over time.\n\n> **Assumption 2 (Closedness):**  \n> All evolution is internally determined; no new variables, shocks, or external information enter the system.\n\nThese assumptions are not merely technical. They define systems whose trajectories are governed purely by internal geometry, initial conditions, and self-contained rules.\n\nThe **state space** $\\mathcal{M}$ of such a system is typically modeled as a **smooth manifold**—a space that is locally Euclidean but globally subject to constraints. This allows calculus to apply, while enabling the geometry to encode conservation laws, budget constraints, or normalization conditions.\n\n- In **ecology**, $\\mathbb{R}_+^n$ encodes non-negativity of populations.\n- In **replicator dynamics**, the state space is the **unit simplex** $\\Delta^{n-1} = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\sum x_i = 1, x_i \\geq 0 \\}$.\n- In **capital allocation models**, the feasible set may be a convex polytope defined by resource bounds or investment constraints.\n\nThe essential idea is that the system’s trajectory is confined to this manifold—it does not escape, deform, or expand it. This confinement is a direct consequence of autonomy and closure. For instance, replicator dynamics preserve the normalization constraint $\\sum x_i = 1$ by construction.\n\n> The manifold defines what kinds of motion are possible. The system’s evolution is not just determined by initial conditions, but by the **shape of the space itself**.\n\nThis structural logic has a natural analogue in **discrete-time Markov chains**. Let $P$ be an $n \\times n$ row-stochastic matrix, and let $\\mathbf{x}_t$ be a probability distribution over $n$ states:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = P \\mathbf{x}_t, \\quad \\text{with } \\sum x_i = 1.\n$$\n\nHere, the state $\\mathbf{x}_t$ evolves deterministically in distribution, remaining within the unit simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$. Closure is strictly enforced: all transitions are internal, and the total measure is conserved.\n\n- The **state space** is again the simplex.\n- The **update rule** is linear but structure-preserving.\n- The **equilibrium** is a fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^*$ satisfying $P \\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{x}^*$.\n\nThis illustrates a shared architectural principle. Whether in **continuous-time deterministic systems (e.g., ODEs)** or **discrete-time stochastic systems** (e.g., Markov chains), the system evolves within a fixed, internally governed manifold. In both, long-run behavior—such as steady states, cycles, or invariant measures—is dictated not by external information, but by **the shape and rules of the system itself**. Whether deterministic or stochastic, closed systems are defined less by what they allow and more by what they prohibit: change without structure, innovation without rules, and motion without constraint.\n\n\nAbsolutely. You're exactly right: many ODE-based level models, especially those involving population or capital dynamics, can be **normalized** into share-based systems that resemble **Markov chains** (in structure if not in stochastic interpretation). Below is a continuation you can insert into the **Closed System Dynamics** section. It explains the normalization process, gives a concrete derivation, and highlights when and how the dynamics transition from nonlinear to linear under certain assumptions.\n\n\n## Normalization \n\n> from Levels to Shares: ODEs as Markov-like Systems\n\nIn many economic or ecological models, the system is initially formulated in **absolute levels**. Consider a general two-dimensional ODE system describing the interaction of two populations—such as labor ($L$) and capital ($C$), or prey and predator:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{L}(t) &= f_L(L, C), \\\\\n\\dot{C}(t) &= f_C(L, C).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis level-based description captures total quantity dynamics. However, in many contexts, what matters is not the absolute size of each group but their **relative share** in the system. For this, we define normalized states:\n\n$$\n\\ell(t) = \\frac{L(t)}{L(t) + C(t)}, \\quad c(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{L(t) + C(t)},\n$$\n\nso that $\\ell + c = 1$. The state space becomes the **1-simplex** $\\Delta^1 = \\{ (\\ell, c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\ell + c = 1, \\, \\ell, c \\ge 0 \\}$.\n\nLet $S(t) = L(t) + C(t)$ denote the total. Then using the quotient rule, the share dynamics are:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\ell} = \\frac{f_L \\cdot S - L \\cdot (f_L + f_C)}{S^2}.\n$$\n\nRewriting in terms of $\\ell$ and $c$:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\ell} = \\ell (f_L - \\bar{f}), \\quad \\text{where } \\bar{f} = \\ell f_L + c f_C.\n$$\n\nThis equation takes the exact form of **replicator dynamics**, familiar from evolutionary game theory. It describes the differential success of one component relative to the population-weighted average.\n\nThis transformation reveals a deep structural insight:  \n> **Many nonlinear level-based systems can be recast as share-based, constrained systems evolving on a simplex.**\n\nGeneralizing to $n$-dimensional systems: suppose we have $\\mathbf{x}(t) = (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^n$, and define normalized shares:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{x}_i(t) = \\frac{x_i(t)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j(t)}.\n$$\n\nThen the normalized dynamics become:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{x}}_i = \\tilde{x}_i \\left[ g_i(\\mathbf{x}) - \\sum_j \\tilde{x}_j g_j(\\mathbf{x}) \\right],\n$$\n\nwhich is again replicator-type dynamics—a nonlinear but share-preserving flow over the simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$.\n\nNow consider the special case where the original system is **linear**:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = A \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\text{with } A \\text{ a non-negative matrix}.\n$$\n\nAfter normalization, the system evolves as:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot (A - \\bar{a} I),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{a} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}^\\top A \\mathbf{1}$ is the average growth rate. This dynamics mimics the evolution of a **discrete-time Markov chain** in continuous time—particularly when $A$ is column-stochastic (or conserves total mass, i.e., $\\sum_i \\dot{x}_i = 0$).\n\n> **Key Structural Insight:**  \n> - Level dynamics describe **absolute accumulation or depletion**.  \n> - Share dynamics describe **relative competition or reproduction**.  \n> - The latter induces a **geometry over the simplex**, mirroring that of **Markov chains** or **probabilistic flows**.\n\nThis connection is more than formal. In applied settings, analyzing normalized dynamics often simplifies the structure, isolates systemic selection mechanisms, and aligns with probabilistic interpretations.\n\n> A closed ODE system can often be interpreted in **dual form**:  \n> - As **mass evolution** in $\\mathbb{R}_+^n$  \n> - As **probability evolution** in $\\Delta^{n-1}$  \n\nBoth views preserve internal consistency but emphasize different types of systemic constraint: **conservation of total quantity** vs. **invariance of share structure**.\n\n\n## Fixed Points and Their Existence\n\nA central goal in the study of closed dynamical systems is to characterize their long-run behavior. The most fundamental concept in this regard is the **fixed point**—a state in which the system remains unchanged under its own dynamics.\n\n> **Definition (Fixed Point):**  \n> A point $\\mathbf{x}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a fixed point of the system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = f(\\mathbf{x})$ if:\n> $$\n> f(\\mathbf{x}^*) = 0.\n> $$\n\nAt such a point, the vector field vanishes; the system \"comes to rest\" in a dynamical sense. In closed systems, fixed points are **endogenous attractors**: they arise not by design but by the internal logic of the system itself.\n\n> **Theorem (Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem):**  \n> If $f$ is continuous and maps a **compact** and **convex** subset $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ into itself, then there exists at least one $\\mathbf{x}^* \\in K$ such that $f(\\mathbf{x}^*) = 0$.\n\nThis foundational result guarantees the existence of fixed points in many applied settings, including economics and evolutionary biology, especially when the state space is constrained—for example, to the positive orthant $\\mathbb{R}_+^n$ or the unit simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$.\n\nHowever, **existence** does not imply **uniqueness**, **stability**, or **optimality**. There may be many fixed points, some of which are unstable or economically inefficient.\n\nIn the context of **replicator dynamics**, which often result from normalization of level-based ODEs (as shown in the previous section), fixed points have a natural interpretation:\n\n> **Example (Replicator Dynamics):**  \n> Let $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in \\Delta^2$ represent strategy shares in a 3-type population. The replicator equation is:\n> $$\n> \\dot{x}_i = x_i\\left[(A \\mathbf{x})_i - \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}\\right].\n> $$\n> Every **Nash equilibrium** corresponds to a fixed point of this system.\n\nIn this setting, the equilibrium condition says that any strategy with positive share must yield the same expected payoff as the population average. The resulting fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^*$ reflects **invariance under self-replicating dynamics**: if every strategy earns the average return, no further adjustment occurs.\n\nMore broadly, fixed points serve as candidates for **global asymptotic behavior**—states toward which the system may converge over time. Whether or not this convergence occurs depends on their **stability**, a topic we will address in the next section. But even without stability, fixed points offer an essential structural insight:\n\n> **Fixed points are not always efficient.**  \n> They are not guaranteed to maximize a welfare function, only to satisfy internal consistency.\n\nThis distinction is especially important in economic models. Market equilibria, for example, may persist due to structural constraints, not because they are Pareto optimal. In ecological models, predator-prey balance may be achieved at inefficient population levels, depending on the interaction parameters.\n\nFinally, fixed points are the bridge between **nonlinear systems** and their **linear approximations**. In order to study local stability, we must first locate these points. They form the anchors around which the system's behavior can be analyzed geometrically.\n\n> In summary:  \n> - Fixed points exist under mild conditions (Brouwer).  \n> - They are invariant under the system’s own dynamics.  \n> - They may correspond to equilibria in economic or evolutionary settings.  \n> - Their role is structural, not necessarily optimal.  \n> - Their stability and selection are matters of **local geometry**, not **global design**.\n\n\n## Local Stability and Linear Approximation\n\nOnce fixed points have been identified, the next question is whether they are **locally stable**—that is, whether the system returns to the fixed point after a small perturbation or diverges away. This leads to a key analytical technique: **linearization**, which provides a geometric approximation of the nonlinear system near a fixed point.\n\n> **Definition (Linearization and Jacobian Matrix):**  \n> Given a system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = f(\\mathbf{x})$ and a fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^*$, the system near $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is approximated by:\n> $$\n> \\dot{\\mathbf{x}} \\approx J(\\mathbf{x}^*)(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^*),\n> $$\n> where the **Jacobian matrix** $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ is:\n> $$\n> J(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}(\\mathbf{x}^*) \\right]_{i,j}.\n> $$\n\nThis approximation turns the nonlinear system into a linear one locally, enabling the application of spectral methods. The **eigenvalues** of the Jacobian dictate how perturbations evolve:\n\n- All eigenvalues with **negative real parts** → **locally asymptotically stable** (exponential convergence to equilibrium).\n- Any eigenvalue with a **positive real part** → **locally unstable**.\n- All eigenvalues with **nonzero real parts** → the fixed point is a **hyperbolic steady state**.\n\n> **Theorem (Hartman–Grobman):**  \n> If $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ has no eigenvalues with zero real part, the nonlinear system near $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is **topologically conjugate** to its linearization. That is, it behaves qualitatively like the linearized system in a neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}^*$.\n\n> **Example (Community Matrix in Ecology):**  \n> For a model such as $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{x}) A \\mathbf{x}$, with fixed point satisfying $A \\mathbf{x}^* = 0$, the Jacobian becomes:\n> $$\n> J(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{x}^*) A.\n> $$\n> This **community matrix** expresses how each population or strategy reacts to small changes in others.\n\nThe **Jacobian spectrum** reflects the **local geometry** of the vector field. However, this geometry does not arise in isolation—it is a projection of the **global structure** of the system, determined by interaction rules, constraints, and feedback topology.\n\n> In this sense:  \n> The local geometry does not determine the system. It is a **localized expression of the global architecture**—visible through differential structure at the fixed point.\n\n> **Example (Predator–Prey System):**  \n> In a Lotka–Volterra system, if $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ has purely imaginary eigenvalues, the system exhibits **neutral cycles**.  \n> If eigenvalues have negative real parts, trajectories **spiral back** to equilibrium.\n\nIn finance or economics, **local stability** is often interpreted as **bounded response** of prices, capital stocks, or returns. But such interpretations are frequently **assumed**, not derived from first principles.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In dynamic asset pricing, if **gross return** $R_t$ is used, stability typically assumes $0 < R_t < 1$ (i.e., contraction).\n- When **net return** $r_t$ is used, the “stable” range becomes $-1 < r_t < 1$.\n- These assumptions echo the convergence criteria of **geometric series**, though models rarely state this explicitly.\n\nIn stochastic frameworks, such as intertemporal asset pricing, the **Martingale Convergence Theorem** is often invoked under a discounted summation condition:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta^t R_t\\right] < \\infty,\n$$\n\nThis converges **if and only if** $\\beta R < 1$, which is again a condition for the convergence of an infinite geometric series. It corresponds, in spectral terms, to requiring that the **spectral radius** of the return operator be **less than one**.\n\nThus, across frameworks:\n\n- **Negative real eigenvalues** (in continuous-time ODEs) imply contraction via exponential decay.\n- **Spectral radius < 1** (in discrete-time or stochastic models) ensures convergence through bounded iteration.\n- **Imaginary eigenvalues** indicate **cyclic** or **oscillatory** local behavior.\n\n> Yet in mainstream economic models, these conditions are often treated as if **structurally self-evident**, when they are in fact **mathematical assumptions**—frequently unacknowledged and untested.  \n> Different parameterizations (e.g., gross vs. net returns) shift the meaning of “stability,” but this shift is rarely made explicit.\n\nWhat appears as “natural stability” is often a restatement of **basic spectral convergence conditions**. The deeper question is not whether the system is stable, but **what structural mechanisms** produce or undermine stability—and whether they correspond to economic reality or analytical convenience.\n\nLocal linearization thus acts as a **microscope**: it allows us to classify equilibrium behavior based on **local differential structure**, even if the **global landscape** remains nonlinear and complex. Local stability is not a measure of global optimality. It is a statement about **local resilience**, shaped by the system's internal feedback at that point.\n\n\n## Replicator Dynamics and Nash Equilibrium\n\nReplicator dynamics is a canonical framework for modeling how the relative shares of competing strategies evolve over time under selection pressure. The dynamics are defined on the **unit simplex** $\\Delta^{n-1} = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\sum x_i = 1,\\, x_i \\ge 0 \\}$, which represents normalized population shares, probability distributions, or strategy proportions. The simplex is a **smooth manifold with boundary**, meaning that trajectories are constrained not only by dimensionality but also by the non-negativity and summation conditions.\n\nLet $A$ be an $n \\times n$ payoff matrix, and let $\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\Delta^{n-1}$ be the population state. The **replicator equation** is given by:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_i = x_i\\left[(A\\mathbf{x})_i - \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}\\right], \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n.\n$$\n\nThis describes a **nonlinear system** where each type grows or declines based on its **relative performance** compared to the population average. The term $(A\\mathbf{x})_i$ represents the fitness or payoff of type $i$, and $\\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$ is the average fitness.\n\n- If $(A\\mathbf{x})_i > \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$, then $x_i$ increases.\n- If $(A\\mathbf{x})_i < \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$, then $x_i$ decreases.\n\n> **Remark:** The geometry of the simplex ensures that the total sum $\\sum x_i = 1$ is preserved over time. This is crucial—it implies that the vector field is always **tangential to the simplex**, never pointing outward or inward, thus reinforcing the idea of a **closed system** on a constrained manifold.\n\n\nEvery **Nash equilibrium** $\\mathbf{x}^*$ of the game defined by payoff matrix $A$ is a **fixed point** of the replicator dynamics. This means:\n\n$$\nx_i^* > 0 \\Rightarrow (A\\mathbf{x}^*)_i = \\mathbf{x}^{*\\top} A \\mathbf{x}^*, \\quad \\forall i.\n$$\n\nAt such a point, no type has an incentive to grow or shrink—each performs identically in expectation, relative to the population average.\n\nThese fixed points reflect **internal compatibility**, not global optimality. Even suboptimal strategies can persist if they are structurally embedded or protected by the system’s interaction structure.\n\n\nTo analyze behavior near such equilibria, we compute the **Jacobian matrix** $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ of the replicator dynamics. If none of its eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis—i.e., if $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is a **hyperbolic steady state**—then the local behavior is governed by the linearized system.\n\n> This is precisely where we invoke the Hartman–Grobman theorem (as previously discussed): local trajectories behave qualitatively like those of the linearized system near the fixed point.\n\n- If all eigenvalues have **negative real parts**, the Nash equilibrium is **locally asymptotically stable**.\n- If any eigenvalues have **positive real parts**, the point is **locally unstable**.\n- A mixture of signs yields **saddle-type behavior**.\n\n> **Example (3-Strategy Game):**  \nIn a rock–paper–scissors setup with equal payoffs, the interior Nash equilibrium is **neutrally stable**: the Jacobian has purely imaginary eigenvalues, resulting in **closed orbits**. However, small deformations to the payoff structure can lead to **damping** (attracting focus) or **amplifying spirals** (repelling cycles), depending on the spectral shift.\n\n**Boundary behavior:** If the system approaches the boundary of the simplex, such as when one type goes extinct ($x_i \\to 0$), then the dynamics reduce in dimension and may settle into **absorbing states**—a hallmark of **path dependence** and structural lock-in, often observed in socioeconomic systems.\n\n\nThere exists a formal topological equivalence between replicator dynamics and Lotka–Volterra systems. Specifically, the 3-dimensional replicator system:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_i = x_i\\left[(A\\mathbf{x})_i - \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}\\right], \\quad \\sum x_i = 1,\n$$\n\nis **diffeomorphic** to a 2-dimensional generalized Lotka–Volterra system via coordinate transformations that map the simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$ to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ (cf. Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998).\n\nThis correspondence highlights a shared logic of **nonlinear self-interaction**, **feedback amplification**, and **constrained growth** across domains:\n\n- In **ecology**, predator-prey cycles arise without optimization.\n- In **economics**, inefficient strategies or norms may persist by structural embedding.\n- In **institutional dynamics**, dominant behaviors may lock in without being globally optimal.\n\n> **Takeaway:**  \n> A Nash equilibrium in replicator dynamics is not merely a rest point of strategic interaction. It is often a **hyperbolic fixed point** shaped and stabilized by the system's internal structure.  \n> Its stability reflects not only the local geometry but the **global constraints and feedback architecture** of the system.\n\n\n## Perron–Frobenius and Dominant States\n\nIn both **discrete-time Markov chains** and **linear continuous-time ODE systems**, the question of long-run behavior often reduces to identifying **dominant structures**—not necessarily the best performing, but the most structurally entrenched. These are the states or directions that persist, absorb, and eventually dominate the system’s trajectory.\n\nLet us begin with the discrete-time case.\n\n### Discrete-time: Markov Chains and Invariant Distributions\n\nConsider a finite-state Markov chain with transition matrix $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ satisfying:\n\n- $P_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all $i,j$ (non-negativity),\n- $\\sum_j P_{ij} = 1$ for all $i$ (row stochasticity).\n\nThis defines an evolution of probability distributions over $n$ states:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = P \\mathbf{x}_t.\n$$\n\nThe long-run behavior is governed by the **invariant distribution** $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ satisfying:\n\n$$\nP \\boldsymbol{\\pi} = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}.\n$$\n\nUnder the mild condition that $P$ is **irreducible** and **aperiodic**, the Perron–Frobenius theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a strictly positive invariant vector $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} > 0$. Regardless of the initial condition $\\mathbf{x}_0$, the system converges:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{x}_t = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}.\n$$\n\n> **Theorem (Perron–Frobenius, stochastic form):**  \n> For an irreducible stochastic matrix $P$, the largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 1$, with a unique strictly positive eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ satisfying $P\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. All other eigenvalues satisfy $|\\lambda_i| < 1$.\n\nThis invariant distribution encodes the **long-run frequency** of each state—not because those states are inherently superior, but because they are **structurally reinforced**.\n\n\n### Continuous-Time: Linear ODEs and Eigenvector Dominance\n\nNow consider a linear continuous-time system:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = A \\mathbf{x},\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a non-negative, irreducible matrix. The solution is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{At} \\mathbf{x}_0.\n$$\n\nIn this setting, Perron–Frobenius theory again applies: the matrix $A$ has a **dominant eigenvalue** $\\lambda_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with the largest real part, and the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1 > 0$ determines the direction of long-run growth:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{x}(t)\\|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_1}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_1\\|}, \\quad \\text{assuming } \\mathbf{x}_0 \\not\\perp \\mathbf{v}_1.\n$$\n\nThat is, over time the trajectory aligns with $\\mathbf{v}_1$, even if initial conditions pointed elsewhere. All other modes decay (or oscillate) relative to this dominant direction.\n\n> **Spectral Dominance Principle:**  \n> The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue **absorbs and aligns** the system’s trajectory over time. It defines not just equilibrium, but the **structural tendency** of the system.\n\n### Structural Interpretation\n\nIn both stochastic and linear dynamical settings, dominance may not arise from merit—it may emerges from **network topology**, **feedback structure**, and **reinforcement logic**. This has profound implications for economic and institutional systems.\n\n> **Example (Capital Allocation):**  \n> Suppose a set of firms or sectors reallocates capital over time according to a stable Markov transition matrix $P$. Even if capital initially diffuses broadly, over time it concentrates in the states corresponding to high values in the **Perron vector** $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. These are not necessarily the most productive or innovative firms—they are the ones with **persistent inflows**, **self-reinforcement**, or **structural centrality**.\n\nThis reveals a critical insight:\n\n> Persistence is not always driven by contribution.\n> In many systems, it is driven by **connectivity**—a measure of how embedded a node is in the system’s transition logic.\n\nThis applies equally in:\n\n- **Finance** (e.g., asset flows concentrating in TBTF institutions),\n- **Social networks** (e.g., attention concentrating on central nodes),\n- **Political systems** (e.g., power concentrating in deeply institutionalized actors).\n\nThe Perron eigenvector is often invisible in short-run observations. It emerges over time—just as compound interest, reputation, or market share slowly diverge. It represents a kind of **topological power**: a state’s ability to maintain and attract flow simply by virtue of its **location in the interaction structure**.\n\n> **Mathematical analogy:** In spectral graph theory, centrality measures like **PageRank** are nothing but Perron vectors of stochastic adjacency matrices. The same applies here—dominance is the outcome of **structural centrality**, not performance in any exogenous sense.\n\nThe Perron–Frobenius theorem is not merely an algebraic artifact—it provides a **structural lens** for understanding long-run dominance:\n\n- In **Markov chains**, the invariant distribution reflects probabilistic entrenchment.\n- In **linear ODEs**, the dominant eigenvector determines trajectory alignment.\n- In **capital systems**, the dominant state absorbs wealth flows without necessarily earning them.\n\nWhat persists is not necessarily what performs—it is what **connects**, **absorbs**, and **aligns**. Dominance in closed systems is often a function of **topological position**, not marginal productivity.\n\nThis sets the stage for the next section: to what extent do such structures reflect **selection under constraint** versus **selection by innovation**? And how can we distinguish **structural lock-in** from true competitive superiority?\n\n\n## Selection under Constraint in Quasi-Closed Systems\n\nNot all persistence is evidence of superior performance. In many empirical systems, especially economic and institutional ones, long-run survival emerges not through innovation, but through **structural embedding**. These systems function as if they were **closed**, even when occasional shocks or entries occur. We refer to such regimes as **quasi-closed systems**: systems where the underlying architecture evolves slowly, and where structural inertia dominates strategic choice.\n\nQuasi-closed systems share several defining features. First, the **entry and exit of agents** is infrequent; new firms, products, or individuals rarely alter the overall configuration. Second, the **transition structure**—how states evolve or shift—remains relatively stable over time. Third, the **definition of identities** (such as firm types, classes, or asset categories) tends to be fixed ex ante, with little endogenous mutation. Finally, outcome divergence arises primarily through **growth differentials**, not fundamental innovation. Agents do not win because they change the game; they win because they are positioned advantageously within the existing one.\n\nThis is not evolutionary competition. It is **fixation without adaptation**—a dynamic in which the system converges toward a stratified hierarchy of outcomes, even in the absence of meaningful differentiation in performance.\n\nConventional economic narratives typically invoke a logic of **selection by merit**: those who persist must be those who perform better. But in quasi-closed systems, **structural position outweighs competitive edge**. Survival and dominance reflect where an agent begins, not necessarily how they behave. The analogy often drawn from biology—\"survival of the fittest\"—is more Spencerian than Darwinian. Spencer’s framework implies that survival evidences superiority. Darwin’s actual theory emphasized **contextual fit**: species survive when they are **viable within given constraints**, not because they are globally optimal. In this distinction lies a profound shift in explanatory logic: from **performance-based selection** to **constraint-based persistence**.\n\nEconomic systems often display the same structural logic. Capital tends to concentrate not due to constant outperformance, but due to **preferential attachment**: once capital accumulates disproportionately, future inflows tend to reinforce this advantage. Even in the absence of marginal superiority, historical position becomes a gravitational center. As shown in **Perron–Frobenius-type dynamics**, long-run dominance is determined not by productivity, but by **connectivity within the transition structure**—topological advantage, not economic value, dictates persistence.\n\nThis insight reveals why closed and quasi-closed models are so useful: they allow us to study how **structure itself generates inequality**. Within these frameworks, we can formally identify **fixed points**, **hyperbolic steady states**, and **invariant sets**. We can trace dominance to the **eigenstructure of interaction matrices**. We can classify local stability, and project global path dependence. But this analytical clarity comes with a cost. By design, such models **exclude structural mutation**. They assume that the architecture of the system is fixed—even as it generates asymmetry.\n\nReal-world economic history, however, is shaped as much by **ruptures** as by reinforcements. New technologies, regulatory collapses, and institutional realignments frequently destroy the closed logic of existing systems. These events cannot be interpreted as small shocks; they are **structural mutations**. When automation displaces labor, when digital platforms rewire capital flows, when financial regimes collapse—the topology of the system changes. These are not deviations within a closed phase space. They mark the birth of a new one.\n\nThe implication is clear. **Persistence is not proof of merit**. It is often the artifact of **selection under structural constraint**, reinforced by slowly evolving or frozen interaction rules. Such systems reveal how inequality can emerge and endure even when performance differences are minimal or absent. But they cannot explain how inequality transforms—how new forms emerge, how old structures collapse, how systems adapt or fail to adapt when their internal logics are broken.\n\nTo understand these transitions, we must move beyond the closed framework. The next chapter begins here: with the breakage of internal feedback loops, the introduction of **non-conservative flows**, and the rise of **irreversible dynamics**. In this new setting, **structure itself becomes endogenous**—subject to mutation, decay, and displacement. Closed systems explain how inequality persists; open systems must explain how inequality evolves.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Lotka–Volterra Model\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$ denote the population levels of two interacting species—prey ($x$) and predator ($y$). The classical **Lotka–Volterra equations** describe their nonlinear dynamics as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x} &= x(a_{11} - a_{12} y), \\\\\n\\dot{y} &= y(a_{21} x - a_{22}),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere all parameters $a_{ij} > 0$ represent positive interaction or decay rates. This defines a closed, two-dimensional autonomous system on the positive orthant $\\mathbb{R}_+^2$.\n\nThere are no external shocks, migrations, or species mutations—only endogenous interaction between predator and prey. The predator grows by consuming the prey; the prey reproduces in the absence of predation.\n\nThis system exhibits a distinctive dynamical feature: **closed orbits** in the phase plane. That is, solutions cycle indefinitely without converging to a fixed point or diverging to infinity. This reflects the conservative nature of the system—total “interaction energy” is preserved, and the system perpetually oscillates.\n\n> **Mathematical Insight:** These closed cycles correspond, in the frequency domain, to dominant harmonic modes—i.e., a natural periodicity. From a systems-theoretic perspective, this allows interpretation via **Fourier decomposition**, where the cyclical behavior of populations maps to periodic oscillators in signal processing.\n\nThus, the Lotka–Volterra model offers a rich entry point for understanding **non-equilibrium dynamics**, **nonlinear feedback**, and **structural cycles**—core features of many biological and economic systems.\n\n```{python}\n# Simulation Plan\n# 1.

But in **closed systems**, equilibrium should not be mistaken for a “rest state” reflecting optimality or efficiency. Instead, it emerges as a **structural attractor**—a state selected by internal constraints and interaction geometry. It may arise without innovation, adaptation, or optimal design. It is not necessarily **best**; it is simply **allowed** by the rules of the system.\n\nWe formalize a dynamical system on a smooth state space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ as:\n\n> **Definition (Autonomous System):**  \n> An autonomous dynamical system is a pair $(\\mathbb{R}^n, f)$, where $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a continuously differentiable vector field. The evolution of state $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ is governed by:\n> $$\n> \\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = f(\\mathbf{x}), \\quad \\mathbf{x}(0) = \\mathbf{x}_0.\n> $$\n\nHere, the function $f$ captures the internal feedback structure—how the system updates itself from one moment to the next. The system is **autonomous** if $f$ is time-invariant, and **closed** if it excludes any external forcing or dimensional change.\n\n> **Assumption 1 (Autonomy):**  \n> The dynamics do not depend explicitly on time: $\\partial f / \\partial t = 0$. This preserves structural invariance over time.\n\n> **Assumption 2 (Closedness):**  \n> All evolution is internally determined; no new variables, shocks, or external information enter the system.\n\nThese assumptions are not merely technical. They define systems whose trajectories are governed purely by internal geometry, initial conditions, and self-contained rules.\n\nThe **state space** $\\mathcal{M}$ of such a system is typically modeled as a **smooth manifold**—a space that is locally Euclidean but globally subject to constraints. This allows calculus to apply, while enabling the geometry to encode conservation laws, budget constraints, or normalization conditions.\n\n- In **ecology**, $\\mathbb{R}_+^n$ encodes non-negativity of populations.\n- In **replicator dynamics**, the state space is the **unit simplex** $\\Delta^{n-1} = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\sum x_i = 1, x_i \\geq 0 \\}$.\n- In **capital allocation models**, the feasible set may be a convex polytope defined by resource bounds or investment constraints.\n\nThe essential idea is that the system’s trajectory is confined to this manifold—it does not escape, deform, or expand it. This confinement is a direct consequence of autonomy and closure. For instance, replicator dynamics preserve the normalization constraint $\\sum x_i = 1$ by construction.\n\n> The manifold defines what kinds of motion are possible. The system’s evolution is not just determined by initial conditions, but by the **shape of the space itself**.\n\nThis structural logic has a natural analogue in **discrete-time Markov chains**. Let $P$ be an $n \\times n$ row-stochastic matrix, and let $\\mathbf{x}_t$ be a probability distribution over $n$ states:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = P \\mathbf{x}_t, \\quad \\text{with } \\sum x_i = 1.\n$$\n\nHere, the state $\\mathbf{x}_t$ evolves deterministically in distribution, remaining within the unit simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$. Closure is strictly enforced: all transitions are internal, and the total measure is conserved.\n\n- The **state space** is again the simplex.\n- The **update rule** is linear but structure-preserving.\n- The **equilibrium** is a fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^*$ satisfying $P \\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{x}^*$.\n\nThis illustrates a shared architectural principle. Whether in **continuous-time deterministic systems (e.g., ODEs)** or **discrete-time stochastic systems** (e.g., Markov chains), the system evolves within a fixed, internally governed manifold. In both, long-run behavior—such as steady states, cycles, or invariant measures—is dictated not by external information, but by **the shape and rules of the system itself**. Whether deterministic or stochastic, closed systems are defined less by what they allow and more by what they prohibit: change without structure, innovation without rules, and motion without constraint.\n\n\nAbsolutely. You're exactly right: many ODE-based level models, especially those involving population or capital dynamics, can be **normalized** into share-based systems that resemble **Markov chains** (in structure if not in stochastic interpretation). Below is a continuation you can insert into the **Closed System Dynamics** section. It explains the normalization process, gives a concrete derivation, and highlights when and how the dynamics transition from nonlinear to linear under certain assumptions.\n\n\n## Normalization \n\n> from Levels to Shares: ODEs as Markov-like Systems\n\nIn many economic or ecological models, the system is initially formulated in **absolute levels**. Consider a general two-dimensional ODE system describing the interaction of two populations—such as labor ($L$) and capital ($C$), or prey and predator:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{L}(t) &= f_L(L, C), \\\\\n\\dot{C}(t) &= f_C(L, C).\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis level-based description captures total quantity dynamics. However, in many contexts, what matters is not the absolute size of each group but their **relative share** in the system. For this, we define normalized states:\n\n$$\n\\ell(t) = \\frac{L(t)}{L(t) + C(t)}, \\quad c(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{L(t) + C(t)},\n$$\n\nso that $\\ell + c = 1$. The state space becomes the **1-simplex** $\\Delta^1 = \\{ (\\ell, c) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\ell + c = 1, \\, \\ell, c \\ge 0 \\}$.\n\nLet $S(t) = L(t) + C(t)$ denote the total. Then using the quotient rule, the share dynamics are:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\ell} = \\frac{f_L \\cdot S - L \\cdot (f_L + f_C)}{S^2}.\n$$\n\nRewriting in terms of $\\ell$ and $c$:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\ell} = \\ell (f_L - \\bar{f}), \\quad \\text{where } \\bar{f} = \\ell f_L + c f_C.\n$$\n\nThis equation takes the exact form of **replicator dynamics**, familiar from evolutionary game theory. It describes the differential success of one component relative to the population-weighted average.\n\nThis transformation reveals a deep structural insight:  \n> **Many nonlinear level-based systems can be recast as share-based, constrained systems evolving on a simplex.**\n\nGeneralizing to $n$-dimensional systems: suppose we have $\\mathbf{x}(t) = (x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^n$, and define normalized shares:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{x}_i(t) = \\frac{x_i(t)}{\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j(t)}.\n$$\n\nThen the normalized dynamics become:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{x}}_i = \\tilde{x}_i \\left[ g_i(\\mathbf{x}) - \\sum_j \\tilde{x}_j g_j(\\mathbf{x}) \\right],\n$$\n\nwhich is again replicator-type dynamics—a nonlinear but share-preserving flow over the simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$.\n\nNow consider the special case where the original system is **linear**:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = A \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\text{with } A \\text{ a non-negative matrix}.\n$$\n\nAfter normalization, the system evolves as:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot (A - \\bar{a} I),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{a} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}^\\top A \\mathbf{1}$ is the average growth rate. This dynamics mimics the evolution of a **discrete-time Markov chain** in continuous time—particularly when $A$ is column-stochastic (or conserves total mass, i.e., $\\sum_i \\dot{x}_i = 0$).\n\n> **Key Structural Insight:**  \n> - Level dynamics describe **absolute accumulation or depletion**.  \n> - Share dynamics describe **relative competition or reproduction**.  \n> - The latter induces a **geometry over the simplex**, mirroring that of **Markov chains** or **probabilistic flows**.\n\nThis connection is more than formal. In applied settings, analyzing normalized dynamics often simplifies the structure, isolates systemic selection mechanisms, and aligns with probabilistic interpretations.\n\n> A closed ODE system can often be interpreted in **dual form**:  \n> - As **mass evolution** in $\\mathbb{R}_+^n$  \n> - As **probability evolution** in $\\Delta^{n-1}$  \n\nBoth views preserve internal consistency but emphasize different types of systemic constraint: **conservation of total quantity** vs. **invariance of share structure**.\n\n\n## Fixed Points and Their Existence\n\nA central goal in the study of closed dynamical systems is to characterize their long-run behavior. The most fundamental concept in this regard is the **fixed point**—a state in which the system remains unchanged under its own dynamics.\n\n> **Definition (Fixed Point):**  \n> A point $\\mathbf{x}^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a fixed point of the system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = f(\\mathbf{x})$ if:\n> $$\n> f(\\mathbf{x}^*) = 0.\n> $$\n\nAt such a point, the vector field vanishes; the system \"comes to rest\" in a dynamical sense. In closed systems, fixed points are **endogenous attractors**: they arise not by design but by the internal logic of the system itself.\n\n> **Theorem (Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem):**  \n> If $f$ is continuous and maps a **compact** and **convex** subset $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ into itself, then there exists at least one $\\mathbf{x}^* \\in K$ such that $f(\\mathbf{x}^*) = 0$.\n\nThis foundational result guarantees the existence of fixed points in many applied settings, including economics and evolutionary biology, especially when the state space is constrained—for example, to the positive orthant $\\mathbb{R}_+^n$ or the unit simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$.\n\nHowever, **existence** does not imply **uniqueness**, **stability**, or **optimality**. There may be many fixed points, some of which are unstable or economically inefficient.\n\nIn the context of **replicator dynamics**, which often result from normalization of level-based ODEs (as shown in the previous section), fixed points have a natural interpretation:\n\n> **Example (Replicator Dynamics):**  \n> Let $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3) \\in \\Delta^2$ represent strategy shares in a 3-type population. The replicator equation is:\n> $$\n> \\dot{x}_i = x_i\\left[(A \\mathbf{x})_i - \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}\\right].\n> $$\n> Every **Nash equilibrium** corresponds to a fixed point of this system.\n\nIn this setting, the equilibrium condition says that any strategy with positive share must yield the same expected payoff as the population average. The resulting fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^*$ reflects **invariance under self-replicating dynamics**: if every strategy earns the average return, no further adjustment occurs.\n\nMore broadly, fixed points serve as candidates for **global asymptotic behavior**—states toward which the system may converge over time. Whether or not this convergence occurs depends on their **stability**, a topic we will address in the next section. But even without stability, fixed points offer an essential structural insight:\n\n> **Fixed points are not always efficient.**  \n> They are not guaranteed to maximize a welfare function, only to satisfy internal consistency.\n\nThis distinction is especially important in economic models. Market equilibria, for example, may persist due to structural constraints, not because they are Pareto optimal. In ecological models, predator-prey balance may be achieved at inefficient population levels, depending on the interaction parameters.\n\nFinally, fixed points are the bridge between **nonlinear systems** and their **linear approximations**. In order to study local stability, we must first locate these points. They form the anchors around which the system's behavior can be analyzed geometrically.\n\n> In summary:  \n> - Fixed points exist under mild conditions (Brouwer).  \n> - They are invariant under the system’s own dynamics.  \n> - They may correspond to equilibria in economic or evolutionary settings.  \n> - Their role is structural, not necessarily optimal.  \n> - Their stability and selection are matters of **local geometry**, not **global design**.\n\n\n## Local Stability and Linear Approximation\n\nOnce fixed points have been identified, the next question is whether they are **locally stable**—that is, whether the system returns to the fixed point after a small perturbation or diverges away. This leads to a key analytical technique: **linearization**, which provides a geometric approximation of the nonlinear system near a fixed point.\n\n> **Definition (Linearization and Jacobian Matrix):**  \n> Given a system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = f(\\mathbf{x})$ and a fixed point $\\mathbf{x}^*$, the system near $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is approximated by:\n> $$\n> \\dot{\\mathbf{x}} \\approx J(\\mathbf{x}^*)(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}^*),\n> $$\n> where the **Jacobian matrix** $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ is:\n> $$\n> J(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x_j}(\\mathbf{x}^*) \\right]_{i,j}.\n> $$\n\nThis approximation turns the nonlinear system into a linear one locally, enabling the application of spectral methods. The **eigenvalues** of the Jacobian dictate how perturbations evolve:\n\n- All eigenvalues with **negative real parts** → **locally asymptotically stable** (exponential convergence to equilibrium).\n- Any eigenvalue with a **positive real part** → **locally unstable**.\n- All eigenvalues with **nonzero real parts** → the fixed point is a **hyperbolic steady state**.\n\n> **Theorem (Hartman–Grobman):**  \n> If $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ has no eigenvalues with zero real part, the nonlinear system near $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is **topologically conjugate** to its linearization. That is, it behaves qualitatively like the linearized system in a neighborhood of $\\mathbf{x}^*$.\n\n> **Example (Community Matrix in Ecology):**  \n> For a model such as $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{x}) A \\mathbf{x}$, with fixed point satisfying $A \\mathbf{x}^* = 0$, the Jacobian becomes:\n> $$\n> J(\\mathbf{x}^*) = \\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{x}^*) A.\n> $$\n> This **community matrix** expresses how each population or strategy reacts to small changes in others.\n\nThe **Jacobian spectrum** reflects the **local geometry** of the vector field. However, this geometry does not arise in isolation—it is a projection of the **global structure** of the system, determined by interaction rules, constraints, and feedback topology.\n\n> In this sense:  \n> The local geometry does not determine the system. It is a **localized expression of the global architecture**—visible through differential structure at the fixed point.\n\n> **Example (Predator–Prey System):**  \n> In a Lotka–Volterra system, if $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ has purely imaginary eigenvalues, the system exhibits **neutral cycles**.  \n> If eigenvalues have negative real parts, trajectories **spiral back** to equilibrium.\n\nIn finance or economics, **local stability** is often interpreted as **bounded response** of prices, capital stocks, or returns. But such interpretations are frequently **assumed**, not derived from first principles.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In dynamic asset pricing, if **gross return** $R_t$ is used, stability typically assumes $0 < R_t < 1$ (i.e., contraction).\n- When **net return** $r_t$ is used, the “stable” range becomes $-1 < r_t < 1$.\n- These assumptions echo the convergence criteria of **geometric series**, though models rarely state this explicitly.\n\nIn stochastic frameworks, such as intertemporal asset pricing, the **Martingale Convergence Theorem** is often invoked under a discounted summation condition:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\beta^t R_t\\right] < \\infty,\n$$\n\nThis converges **if and only if** $\\beta R < 1$, which is again a condition for the convergence of an infinite geometric series. It corresponds, in spectral terms, to requiring that the **spectral radius** of the return operator be **less than one**.\n\nThus, across frameworks:\n\n- **Negative real eigenvalues** (in continuous-time ODEs) imply contraction via exponential decay.\n- **Spectral radius < 1** (in discrete-time or stochastic models) ensures convergence through bounded iteration.\n- **Imaginary eigenvalues** indicate **cyclic** or **oscillatory** local behavior.\n\n> Yet in mainstream economic models, these conditions are often treated as if **structurally self-evident**, when they are in fact **mathematical assumptions**—frequently unacknowledged and untested.  \n> Different parameterizations (e.g., gross vs. net returns) shift the meaning of “stability,” but this shift is rarely made explicit.\n\nWhat appears as “natural stability” is often a restatement of **basic spectral convergence conditions**. The deeper question is not whether the system is stable, but **what structural mechanisms** produce or undermine stability—and whether they correspond to economic reality or analytical convenience.\n\nLocal linearization thus acts as a **microscope**: it allows us to classify equilibrium behavior based on **local differential structure**, even if the **global landscape** remains nonlinear and complex. Local stability is not a measure of global optimality. It is a statement about **local resilience**, shaped by the system's internal feedback at that point.\n\n\n## Replicator Dynamics and Nash Equilibrium\n\nReplicator dynamics is a canonical framework for modeling how the relative shares of competing strategies evolve over time under selection pressure. The dynamics are defined on the **unit simplex** $\\Delta^{n-1} = \\{ \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\sum x_i = 1,\\, x_i \\ge 0 \\}$, which represents normalized population shares, probability distributions, or strategy proportions. The simplex is a **smooth manifold with boundary**, meaning that trajectories are constrained not only by dimensionality but also by the non-negativity and summation conditions.\n\nLet $A$ be an $n \\times n$ payoff matrix, and let $\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\Delta^{n-1}$ be the population state. The **replicator equation** is given by:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_i = x_i\\left[(A\\mathbf{x})_i - \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}\\right], \\quad i = 1, \\dots, n.\n$$\n\nThis describes a **nonlinear system** where each type grows or declines based on its **relative performance** compared to the population average. The term $(A\\mathbf{x})_i$ represents the fitness or payoff of type $i$, and $\\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$ is the average fitness.\n\n- If $(A\\mathbf{x})_i > \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$, then $x_i$ increases.\n- If $(A\\mathbf{x})_i < \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}$, then $x_i$ decreases.\n\n> **Remark:** The geometry of the simplex ensures that the total sum $\\sum x_i = 1$ is preserved over time. This is crucial—it implies that the vector field is always **tangential to the simplex**, never pointing outward or inward, thus reinforcing the idea of a **closed system** on a constrained manifold.\n\n\nEvery **Nash equilibrium** $\\mathbf{x}^*$ of the game defined by payoff matrix $A$ is a **fixed point** of the replicator dynamics. This means:\n\n$$\nx_i^* > 0 \\Rightarrow (A\\mathbf{x}^*)_i = \\mathbf{x}^{*\\top} A \\mathbf{x}^*, \\quad \\forall i.\n$$\n\nAt such a point, no type has an incentive to grow or shrink—each performs identically in expectation, relative to the population average.\n\nThese fixed points reflect **internal compatibility**, not global optimality. Even suboptimal strategies can persist if they are structurally embedded or protected by the system’s interaction structure.\n\n\nTo analyze behavior near such equilibria, we compute the **Jacobian matrix** $J(\\mathbf{x}^*)$ of the replicator dynamics. If none of its eigenvalues lie on the imaginary axis—i.e., if $\\mathbf{x}^*$ is a **hyperbolic steady state**—then the local behavior is governed by the linearized system.\n\n> This is precisely where we invoke the Hartman–Grobman theorem (as previously discussed): local trajectories behave qualitatively like those of the linearized system near the fixed point.\n\n- If all eigenvalues have **negative real parts**, the Nash equilibrium is **locally asymptotically stable**.\n- If any eigenvalues have **positive real parts**, the point is **locally unstable**.\n- A mixture of signs yields **saddle-type behavior**.\n\n> **Example (3-Strategy Game):**  \nIn a rock–paper–scissors setup with equal payoffs, the interior Nash equilibrium is **neutrally stable**: the Jacobian has purely imaginary eigenvalues, resulting in **closed orbits**. However, small deformations to the payoff structure can lead to **damping** (attracting focus) or **amplifying spirals** (repelling cycles), depending on the spectral shift.\n\n**Boundary behavior:** If the system approaches the boundary of the simplex, such as when one type goes extinct ($x_i \\to 0$), then the dynamics reduce in dimension and may settle into **absorbing states**—a hallmark of **path dependence** and structural lock-in, often observed in socioeconomic systems.\n\n\nThere exists a formal topological equivalence between replicator dynamics and Lotka–Volterra systems. Specifically, the 3-dimensional replicator system:\n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_i = x_i\\left[(A\\mathbf{x})_i - \\mathbf{x}^\\top A \\mathbf{x}\\right], \\quad \\sum x_i = 1,\n$$\n\nis **diffeomorphic** to a 2-dimensional generalized Lotka–Volterra system via coordinate transformations that map the simplex $\\Delta^{n-1}$ to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ (cf. Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998).\n\nThis correspondence highlights a shared logic of **nonlinear self-interaction**, **feedback amplification**, and **constrained growth** across domains:\n\n- In **ecology**, predator-prey cycles arise without optimization.\n- In **economics**, inefficient strategies or norms may persist by structural embedding.\n- In **institutional dynamics**, dominant behaviors may lock in without being globally optimal.\n\n> **Takeaway:**  \n> A Nash equilibrium in replicator dynamics is not merely a rest point of strategic interaction. It is often a **hyperbolic fixed point** shaped and stabilized by the system's internal structure.  \n> Its stability reflects not only the local geometry but the **global constraints and feedback architecture** of the system.\n\n\n## Perron–Frobenius and Dominant States\n\nIn both **discrete-time Markov chains** and **linear continuous-time ODE systems**, the question of long-run behavior often reduces to identifying **dominant structures**—not necessarily the best performing, but the most structurally entrenched. These are the states or directions that persist, absorb, and eventually dominate the system’s trajectory.\n\nLet us begin with the discrete-time case.\n\n### Discrete-time: Markov Chains and Invariant Distributions\n\nConsider a finite-state Markov chain with transition matrix $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ satisfying:\n\n- $P_{ij} \\ge 0$ for all $i,j$ (non-negativity),\n- $\\sum_j P_{ij} = 1$ for all $i$ (row stochasticity).\n\nThis defines an evolution of probability distributions over $n$ states:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = P \\mathbf{x}_t.\n$$\n\nThe long-run behavior is governed by the **invariant distribution** $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ satisfying:\n\n$$\nP \\boldsymbol{\\pi} = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}.\n$$\n\nUnder the mild condition that $P$ is **irreducible** and **aperiodic**, the Perron–Frobenius theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a strictly positive invariant vector $\\boldsymbol{\\pi} > 0$. Regardless of the initial condition $\\mathbf{x}_0$, the system converges:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbf{x}_t = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}.\n$$\n\n> **Theorem (Perron–Frobenius, stochastic form):**  \n> For an irreducible stochastic matrix $P$, the largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 1$, with a unique strictly positive eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ satisfying $P\\boldsymbol{\\pi} = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. All other eigenvalues satisfy $|\\lambda_i| < 1$.\n\nThis invariant distribution encodes the **long-run frequency** of each state—not because those states are inherently superior, but because they are **structurally reinforced**.\n\n\n### Continuous-Time: Linear ODEs and Eigenvector Dominance\n\nNow consider a linear continuous-time system:\n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = A \\mathbf{x},\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a non-negative, irreducible matrix. The solution is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{At} \\mathbf{x}_0.\n$$\n\nIn this setting, Perron–Frobenius theory again applies: the matrix $A$ has a **dominant eigenvalue** $\\lambda_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with the largest real part, and the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1 > 0$ determines the direction of long-run growth:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}(t)}{\\|\\mathbf{x}(t)\\|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_1}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_1\\|}, \\quad \\text{assuming } \\mathbf{x}_0 \\not\\perp \\mathbf{v}_1.\n$$\n\nThat is, over time the trajectory aligns with $\\mathbf{v}_1$, even if initial conditions pointed elsewhere. All other modes decay (or oscillate) relative to this dominant direction.\n\n> **Spectral Dominance Principle:**  \n> The eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue **absorbs and aligns** the system’s trajectory over time. It defines not just equilibrium, but the **structural tendency** of the system.\n\n### Structural Interpretation\n\nIn both stochastic and linear dynamical settings, dominance may not arise from merit—it may emerges from **network topology**, **feedback structure**, and **reinforcement logic**. This has profound implications for economic and institutional systems.\n\n> **Example (Capital Allocation):**  \n> Suppose a set of firms or sectors reallocates capital over time according to a stable Markov transition matrix $P$. Even if capital initially diffuses broadly, over time it concentrates in the states corresponding to high values in the **Perron vector** $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$. These are not necessarily the most productive or innovative firms—they are the ones with **persistent inflows**, **self-reinforcement**, or **structural centrality**.\n\nThis reveals a critical insight:\n\n> Persistence is not always driven by contribution.\n> In many systems, it is driven by **connectivity**—a measure of how embedded a node is in the system’s transition logic.\n\nThis applies equally in:\n\n- **Finance** (e.g., asset flows concentrating in TBTF institutions),\n- **Social networks** (e.g., attention concentrating on central nodes),\n- **Political systems** (e.g., power concentrating in deeply institutionalized actors).\n\nThe Perron eigenvector is often invisible in short-run observations. It emerges over time—just as compound interest, reputation, or market share slowly diverge. It represents a kind of **topological power**: a state’s ability to maintain and attract flow simply by virtue of its **location in the interaction structure**.\n\n> **Mathematical analogy:** In spectral graph theory, centrality measures like **PageRank** are nothing but Perron vectors of stochastic adjacency matrices. The same applies here—dominance is the outcome of **structural centrality**, not performance in any exogenous sense.\n\nThe Perron–Frobenius theorem is not merely an algebraic artifact—it provides a **structural lens** for understanding long-run dominance:\n\n- In **Markov chains**, the invariant distribution reflects probabilistic entrenchment.\n- In **linear ODEs**, the dominant eigenvector determines trajectory alignment.\n- In **capital systems**, the dominant state absorbs wealth flows without necessarily earning them.\n\nWhat persists is not necessarily what performs—it is what **connects**, **absorbs**, and **aligns**. Dominance in closed systems is often a function of **topological position**, not marginal productivity.\n\nThis sets the stage for the next section: to what extent do such structures reflect **selection under constraint** versus **selection by innovation**? And how can we distinguish **structural lock-in** from true competitive superiority?\n\n\n## Selection under Constraint in Quasi-Closed Systems\n\nNot all persistence is evidence of superior performance. In many empirical systems, especially economic and institutional ones, long-run survival emerges not through innovation, but through **structural embedding**. These systems function as if they were **closed**, even when occasional shocks or entries occur. We refer to such regimes as **quasi-closed systems**: systems where the underlying architecture evolves slowly, and where structural inertia dominates strategic choice.\n\nQuasi-closed systems share several defining features. First, the **entry and exit of agents** is infrequent; new firms, products, or individuals rarely alter the overall configuration. Second, the **transition structure**—how states evolve or shift—remains relatively stable over time. Third, the **definition of identities** (such as firm types, classes, or asset categories) tends to be fixed ex ante, with little endogenous mutation. Finally, outcome divergence arises primarily through **growth differentials**, not fundamental innovation. Agents do not win because they change the game; they win because they are positioned advantageously within the existing one.\n\nThis is not evolutionary competition. It is **fixation without adaptation**—a dynamic in which the system converges toward a stratified hierarchy of outcomes, even in the absence of meaningful differentiation in performance.\n\nConventional economic narratives typically invoke a logic of **selection by merit**: those who persist must be those who perform better. But in quasi-closed systems, **structural position outweighs competitive edge**. Survival and dominance reflect where an agent begins, not necessarily how they behave. The analogy often drawn from biology—\"survival of the fittest\"—is more Spencerian than Darwinian. Spencer’s framework implies that survival evidences superiority. Darwin’s actual theory emphasized **contextual fit**: species survive when they are **viable within given constraints**, not because they are globally optimal. In this distinction lies a profound shift in explanatory logic: from **performance-based selection** to **constraint-based persistence**.\n\nEconomic systems often display the same structural logic. Capital tends to concentrate not due to constant outperformance, but due to **preferential attachment**: once capital accumulates disproportionately, future inflows tend to reinforce this advantage. Even in the absence of marginal superiority, historical position becomes a gravitational center. As shown in **Perron–Frobenius-type dynamics**, long-run dominance is determined not by productivity, but by **connectivity within the transition structure**—topological advantage, not economic value, dictates persistence.\n\nThis insight reveals why closed and quasi-closed models are so useful: they allow us to study how **structure itself generates inequality**. Within these frameworks, we can formally identify **fixed points**, **hyperbolic steady states**, and **invariant sets**. We can trace dominance to the **eigenstructure of interaction matrices**. We can classify local stability, and project global path dependence. But this analytical clarity comes with a cost. By design, such models **exclude structural mutation**. They assume that the architecture of the system is fixed—even as it generates asymmetry.\n\nReal-world economic history, however, is shaped as much by **ruptures** as by reinforcements. New technologies, regulatory collapses, and institutional realignments frequently destroy the closed logic of existing systems. These events cannot be interpreted as small shocks; they are **structural mutations**. When automation displaces labor, when digital platforms rewire capital flows, when financial regimes collapse—the topology of the system changes. These are not deviations within a closed phase space. They mark the birth of a new one.\n\nThe implication is clear. **Persistence is not proof of merit**. It is often the artifact of **selection under structural constraint**, reinforced by slowly evolving or frozen interaction rules. Such systems reveal how inequality can emerge and endure even when performance differences are minimal or absent. But they cannot explain how inequality transforms—how new forms emerge, how old structures collapse, how systems adapt or fail to adapt when their internal logics are broken.\n\nTo understand these transitions, we must move beyond the closed framework. The next chapter begins here: with the breakage of internal feedback loops, the introduction of **non-conservative flows**, and the rise of **irreversible dynamics**. In this new setting, **structure itself becomes endogenous**—subject to mutation, decay, and displacement. Closed systems explain how inequality persists; open systems must explain how inequality
