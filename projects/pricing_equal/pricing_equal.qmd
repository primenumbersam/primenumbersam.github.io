title: Pricing the Equal Opportunities under Structural Inequality
subtitle: An EMM-based Asset Pricing Approach
author: GitSAM
date: today
abstract: This study examines the valuation of seemingly equal opportunities that, due to structural societal inequalities, hold different absolute values for distinct social classes. By applying the Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM) approach within the framework of rational asset pricing theory, we analyze how capital constraints and limits to arbitrage perpetuate inefficiencies in opportunity valuation between the proletariat and capitalist classes.
