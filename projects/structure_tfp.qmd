# TFP (총요소생산성)

## Introduction 

**The growth rate of Total Factor Productivity (TFP)** is **not** a fixed constant; rather, it evolves over time and may be subject to long-term decline. While mainstream macroeconomic **models** frequently assume a constant TFP growth rate, this assumption is increasingly being questioned. Several structural factors—diminishing returns to R&D, demographic constraints, and sectoral shifts towards lower-productivity industries—suggest that aggregate TFP growth may continue to slow. However, TFP growth is not uniform across sectors. Certain industries, such as AI, biotechnology, and advanced energy technologies, exhibit significantly higher productivity gains, leading to growing **sectoral disparities** in innovation.  

From an econometric perspective, a decline in TFP growth could alter its stationarity properties, weakening its stochastic trend and making it more likely to transition **from** an $I(1)$ (non-stationary) stochastic process **to** an $I(0)$ (stationary) stochastic process. If **structural breaks** exist in TFP growth, traditional time-series models based on constant-trend cointegration **assumptions** may fail. Thus, accurately modeling TFP trends requires dynamic econometric techniques that account for **time-varying structural changes**.  

## Main

### Understanding TFP in Macroeconomic Models

TFP represents technological progress that enhances economic output beyond capital and labor inputs. In the **Solow-Swan growth model**, TFP follows an **exponential trend**, expressed as:

$$
A_t = A_0 e^{gt} \epsilon_t
$$

where $g$ is the growth rate and $\epsilon_t$ captures **short-term fluctuations**. This implies that TFP is not strictly stationary; rather, its log form follows a unit root process with a deterministic trend:

$$
\log A_t = g t + u_t, \quad u_t \sim I(0)
$$

Thus, mainstream macroeconomic models do **not** assume TFP is stationary in levels, **but** often assume its deviation from trend is stationary.

### Empirical Evidence on TFP Stationarity

Empirical studies show:

- **Long-Run TFP** behaves as a non-stationary process ($I(1)$), meaning that it exhibits persistent growth and shocks that do not revert over time.
- **Short-Run TFP Shocks** (deviations from trend) are often stationary ($I(0)$) process.

If GDP and capital stock are also $I(1)$, Solow's production function suggests they should be cointegrated:

$$
\log Y_t - \alpha \log K_t - (1-\alpha) \log L_t - g t = u_t, \quad u_t \sim I(0)
$$

Thus, GDP, capital, and labor may be cointegrated due to the common trend driven by TFP.

### Is TFP Growth Declining in the Long Run?

Many studies suggest that TFP growth rates have declined since the mid-20th century.

**U.S. TFP Growth Trends (Annual Growth Rates)**:

- **1950s–1970s:** ~2.5% per year  
- **1980s–1990s:** ~1.5% per year  
- **2000s–2020s:** ~0.5%-1.0% per year  

The **productivity slowdown hypothesis** suggests that **long-term economic growth potential** is becoming weaker than before.

### Why Might TFP Growth Decline Over Time?

Several key factors contribute to the observed decline in TFP growth:

1. **The Low-Hanging Fruit Hypothesis (Gordon, 2016)**  
   - Past technological revolutions (electricity, automobiles, antibiotics) were **one-time events** that provided massive boosts.  
   - Recent innovations (social media, fintech, AI) may not have the same economy-wide productivity effects.

2. **Declining R&D Efficiency (Bloom et al., 2020)**  
   - "Ideas are getting harder to find."  
   - R&D investment has increased, but the number of researchers needed to sustain TFP growth has risen exponentially.

3. **Demographic Constraints and Human Capital Decay**  
   - **Aging populations** in advanced economies reduce labor force dynamism and innovation.  
   - **Education quality improvements** may have plateaued, reducing skilled labor supply.

4. **Sectoral Shift to Low-Productivity Industries**  
   - Advanced economies have shifted **from** manufacturing **to** services (e.g., healthcare, education, public sector).  
   - Services typically have lower TFP growth, as they rely heavily on human labor and are difficult to automate.

5. **Increased Regulation and Market Distortions**  
   - **Growing regulations, tax policies, and political uncertainty** increase inefficiencies, reducing overall productivity.  

### Could TFP Growth Accelerate Again?

While aggregate TFP growth may appear to be declining, there are **huge disparities across sectors**. Just as **wealth concentration is increasing**, TFP growth could also be **highly concentrated within specific industries**:

1. **AI and Automation**  
   - AI-driven automation could drastically improve productivity, particularly in certain white-collar jobs.  
   - However, productivity gains may be highly concentrated in tech-driven industries, rather than the economy as a whole.

2. **Sectoral Disparities in TFP Growth**  
   - **Within-market concentration**: A small number of firms (e.g., winners in the winner-takes-all structure) are experiencing high TFP growth, while others stagnate.  
   - **Cross-market concentration**: Some sectors (AI, biotech) may experience massive productivity boosts, while others (traditional services, public sector) may stagnate.

3. **Energy Revolution and New Technological Frontiers**  
   - Advances in nuclear fusion, renewables, and space-based energy production could dramatically shift TFP growth.  
   - However, large-scale adoption is **slow** due to political, regulatory, and financial constraints.

## Conclusion

### Implications for Time Series Analysis

**If the long-run TFP growth rate is declining**, its stochastic trend may weaken, making it more likely to transition from a unit root ($I(1)$) process to a stationary ($I(0)$) process over time. This has important implications for **empirical modeling** and **forecasting**, particularly in cases where researchers **assume** a **constant growth trend** in **TFP-driven models**. To properly account for these shifts, researchers should:  

- Use **structural break tests** (e.g., **Bai-Perron**) to detect shifts in TFP growth trends and assess whether different growth regimes exist.  
- Apply **rolling unit root tests** to examine whether TFP has moved from an $I(1)$ process toward an $I(0)$ process over time.  
- Incorporate **time-varying cointegration approaches** to avoid biased estimations that assume stable relationships in **economic growth models**.  

### Remarks

TFP growth is not uniform across industries; while aggregate TFP growth may be declining, specific sectors are experiencing rapid technological advancements. Just as **wealth** and **market concentration** have increased, **TFP gains** are increasingly concentrated within high-tech and innovation-driven industries. The result is a growing **disparity** between leading-edge industries (AI, biotech, energy) and traditional sectors (public services, healthcare, education), which exhibit slower productivity improvements.  

As **sectoral divergence** in productivity widens, traditional macroeconomic models that assume **homogeneous TFP growth** may require revision. Future research should focus on developing **heterogeneous growth models** that account for **cross-sectoral differences**, while also employing more dynamic econometric techniques to capture the evolving nature of TFP trends.


# Appendix: Covariance Stationarity, Integration Order, and Cointegration

Covariance stationarity and cointegration describe different statistical properties of time series data. **Covariance stationarity** applies to series where mean, variance, and autocovariance do not change over time, while **cointegration** describes cases where non-stationary $I(1)$ time-series maintain a stable long-run equilibrium. This study explores how these concepts relate and how **cointegration allows for non-stationary series to form stationary linear combinations**.

## Integration Order

The **integration order** of a time series determines how many times it must be **differenced** to become **stationary**. A series is:

- $I(0)$ (stationary) process if it has a constant mean, variance, and autocovariance.
- $I(1)$ (unit root) process if it is non-stationary but becomes stationary after first differencing.
- $I(d)$ process if it requires $d$ differences to become stationary.

Economic time series such as **GDP, money supply, and asset prices** often exhibit $I(1)$ behavior, meaning they contain **stochastic trends** and require differencing to achieve **stationarity**.

## Joint Covariance Stationarity vs. Cointegration

**Joint covariance stationarity** applies when **each** time-series maintains a constant mean, variance, and autocovariance over time. **Cointegration**, on the other hand, describes cases where **two or more** non-stationary $I(1)$ time-series **share** a long-term equilibrium, forming a **stationary linear combination**.

### Joint Covariance Stationary Series (Weak-Sense Stationarity)

A set of time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are **jointly covariance stationary** if they satisfy:

1. **Constant Mean**: $E[X_t] = \mu_X$, $E[Y_t] = \mu_Y$ for all $t$.
2. **Constant Variance**: $Var(X_t)$ and $Var(Y_t)$ do not change over time.
3. **Autocovariance Depends Only on Lag**: $Cov(X_t, X_{t-h})$ and $Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-h})$ depend only on the lag $h$, not on $t$.

If two time series are both **weakly stationary**, then any **linear combination** of them is also stationary.

### Cointegrated Series

A set of time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are **cointegrated** if:

1. Each series is $I(1)$ (non-stationary) process.
2. A **linear combination exists** that is $I(0)$ (stationary) process:

   $$
   \beta_1 X_t + \beta_2 Y_t = u_t
   $$

where $u_t$ is $I(0)$ (stationary) process.

Thus, **even though individual variables are non-stationary, their linear combination is stationary**, implying a **long-run equilibrium relationship**.

### The Relationship Between Covariance Stationarity and Cointegration

| Property | Joint Covariance Stationary Series | Cointegrated Series |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Stationarity** | Each series is stationary (I(0)) | Each series is non-stationary (I(1)), but a linear combination is stationary |
| **Unit Root $I(d)$** | I(0) for each series | I(1) for each series, but a specific linear combination is I(0) |
| **Mean & Variance Stability** | Mean & variance are constant over time | Individual series do not have stable mean & variance, but the combination does |
| **Long-run Relationship** | No long-term relationship constraint | A long-run equilibrium relationship exists |

#### Cointegrated Series Can Be Transformed into Covariance Stationary Series
If $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are **cointegrated**, their first differences $\Delta X_t$, $\Delta Y_t$ (or the residual $u_t$) are stationary.

- The **error correction term** $u_t$ is stationary $I(0)$ process, meaning it satisfies the covariance stationarity conditions.

#### Joint Covariance Stationary Series Are Not Cointegrated
If $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are both **already $I(0)$ (stationary)**, then any linear combination of them is also stationary.

- They cannot be cointegrated because cointegration only applies to non-stationary ($I(1)$) series.
- If all series are already covariance stationary, testing for cointegration is unnecessary.

## Implications for Empirical Analysis

- Before testing for cointegration, check for stationarity. If all series are $I(0)$, cointegration does not apply.
- If series are cointegrated, their residuals (error correction term) should be covariance stationary.
- Many macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP & consumption, money supply & inflation) are cointegrated rather than purely covariance stationary.
