abstract: This study investigates the time-varying cointegration relationships among key U.S. macroeconomic indicators and identifies structural breaks in their long-run equilibrium. Using monthly data from 1990 to 2024, we apply standard unit root and cointegration tests (e.g., Johansen, Engle-Granger), followed by structural break detection methods including the Bai-Perron test and rolling Johansen estimation. The study extends the analysis to fractional and threshold cointegration frameworks to capture long-memory properties and regime-dependent adjustments. Empirical findings suggest that cointegration relationships among economic variables are not stable over time and tend to shift around major macroeconomic shocks. This result highlights the importance of accounting for structural nonstationarities in economic modeling and long-term forecasting.

## 1. Research Overview

This study investigates whether key U.S. economic indicators exhibit **time-varying cointegration** and how structural breaks affect their long-run relationships. The analysis aims to:

- Identify **which variables are cointegrated** in the long term.
- Track **how these relationships evolve** over time.
- Detect and interpret **structural breaks** in equilibrium relationships.
- Extend beyond traditional models by using **fractional and threshold cointegration** frameworks.


## 2. Preliminaries

- **Spurious correlation vs. Cointegration**: High correlation between non-stationary variables may be misleading unless the variables are cointegrated.
- **Cointegration**: A linear combination of I(1) variables that is stationary (I(0)) implies a stable long-term equilibrium.
- **Interpretation**: Variables sharing a cointegration relationship tend to move together over time, despite individual stochastic trends.
- **Empirical Rule**: In long-term data (e.g., >10 years), a correlation coefficient > 0.7 between I(1) series may suggest stable equilibrium.
- **Nelson & Plosser (1982)**: U.S. macroeconomic series often follow stochastic trends, cautioning against naive regression without testing for cointegration.



## 3. Research Questions

1. Which economic indicators form long-term relationships?
2. How have these relationships changed over time?
3. Do identified structural breaks correspond to major economic shocks (e.g., 2008, COVID-19, inflation)?

## 5. Methodology

### A. Testing for Cointegration

#### Step 1: Unit Root Testing
- Ensure variables are I(1)
- Methods:
  - ADF Test
  - Phillips-Perron Test
  - ADF-GLS (ERS)
  - KPSS

#### Step 2: Cointegration Existence
- Apply only if variables are I(1)
- Methods:
  - Johansen Test (multivariate)
  - Engle-Granger Test (pairwise)
- If cointegration fails: consider VAR or short-run models



### B. Detecting Structural Breaks

#### Step 1: Break Detection in Traditional Cointegration
- Methods:
  - Bai-Perron Test
  - Quandt-Andrews Test
  - Rolling Johansen Test
  - CUSUM & CUSUMSQ Tests

#### Step 2: Qualitative Mapping to Events

| Breakpoint      | Likely Cause                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2008-Q3         | Global Financial Crisis             |
| 2011-Q3         | European Debt Crisis                |
| 2020-Q1         | COVID-19 Shock                      |
| 2022-Q1         | Inflation & Fed Rate Hikes          |

Overlay structural breaks with macroeconomic shocks, policy shifts, and global market events.



### C. Fractional Cointegration Extension

#### Step 1: Testing
- Estimate fractional differencing order ($d$) via:
  - GPH Test
  - Robinson Test

#### Step 2: Detecting Breaks
- Use methods for long-memory models:
  - Rolling estimates of $d$
  - Wavelet-based structural break detection
  - Rolling Hurst exponent analysis



### D. Comparison of Breakpoints (Traditional vs. Fractional)
- Common breakpoints strengthen the validity of structural shifts.
- Traditional: discrete shifts; Fractional: gradual long-memory transitions.



### E. Threshold Cointegration Models

#### Step 1: Apply TECM
- Estimate threshold level ($\gamma$)
- Model:
  $$
  \Delta Y_t =
  \begin{cases}
  \alpha_1 (Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1}) + \epsilon_t, & \text{if } |Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1}| > \gamma \\
  \alpha_2 (Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1}) + \epsilon_t, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

#### Step 2: Interpret Regime-dependent Adjustments
- Use Sup-Wald test for significance
- Evaluate asymmetry in adjustment speeds ($\alpha_1 \ne \alpha_2$)



### F. Threshold Fractional Cointegration (TFECM)

#### Step 1: Estimation
- Combine fractional differencing with threshold effects:
  $$
  \Delta Y_t =
  \begin{cases}
  (1 - L)^{d_1} X_t + \epsilon_t, & \text{if } |X_t - \beta Y_t| > \gamma \\
  (1 - L)^{d_2} Y_t + \eta_t, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  $$

#### Step 2: Interpretation
- Captures memory-driven and threshold-based nonlinearity
- Use Sup LM test for threshold significance



## 6. Summary Evaluation

**Strengths**:
- Systematic, step-by-step progression from standard to advanced models
