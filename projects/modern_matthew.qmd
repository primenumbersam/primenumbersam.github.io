## Introduction

This report extends my empirical findings from the ME5 PRIOR research portfolios (of Fama and French) into a broader philosophical and socioeconomic interpretation. I draw connections between large-cap momentum dynamics in capital markets and foundational ideas from ethics, social choice theory, and political philosophy.

The core phenomenon observed—**persistent outperformance among firms that are already the largest and most successful**—bears striking resemblance to the biblical and sociological concept of the **Matthew Effect**:

> "For to every one who has, more will be given..." — *Matthew 25:29*

In financial markets, this is not merely a parable—it is measurable, structural, and persistent. It reveals that what appears to be a free, fair, and competitive economy may in fact be **a self-reinforcing regime of privilege**, cloaked under the language of **freedom, equality, fairness, and consent**—the founding pillars of liberal democracy.


## Structural Inequality at the Firm level

My analysis of the ME5 PRIOR portfolios revealed the following:

- Even within the top 20% of firms by market capitalization (ME5), those that performed best in the prior 11 months (PRIOR5) tend to continue outperforming in the subsequent period.
- This effect is particularly strong **post-2010**, aligning with macroeconomic changes such as quantitative easing, the rise of passive investing, and capital concentration.
- This implies a **reinforcing feedback loop**: prior success draws more capital, more capital enables further success, and performance becomes increasingly **decoupled** from diversification.

The analogy to **social mobility** is immediate: those who have, get more—not just relatively, but **absolutely and increasingly**.


## The Matthew Effect at the Household Level

If capital lock-in dynamics operate not only at the firm level but also across households—a plausible and empirically supported assumption—the implications are far-reaching:

- Wealthy households benefit disproportionately from capital gains and passive income
- Lower- and middle-income households rely predominantly on labor income, with limited upside
- The result is a declining probability of upward mobility, and increasing wealth stratification

This structure undermines the ideal of a meritocratic liberal democracy where opportunity is equitably distributed and fairness is institutionalized. In reality, the capital system begins to resemble a **rigged equilibrium**, where the initial balance is illusionary—**a symbolic counterweight with no real effect.**


## The Philosophical Lens: Arrow, Spinoza, and Pascal

Arrow’s utilitarian social welfare framework assumes at least some degree of fairness and fluidity among agents. But in a setting of structural inequality and declining mobility:

- The **expected utility** of society does not necessarily increase, even if total capital grows
- The **bottom half** of society may experience **static or declining utility**, overwhelmed by the persistent rise of the elite

From a **Spinozist** viewpoint, this is a failure of a rational, self-sustaining society—it lacks balance and cohesion. For **Pascal**, it raises the existential irony of a system designed for all, yet serving few.

And if we apply **Rawls' difference principle**, we see an institutional failure to justify inequality based on benefit to the least advantaged. Liberal democracy, viewed from the perspective of **financial capitalism**, begins to fracture: the ideals of liberty, fairness, and equality become ceremonial rather than structural.


## Toward a New Interpretation of Market Performance

In light of this, the ME5 PRIOR5 outperformance is no longer just a quantitative anomaly or a smart strategy. It is a signal—**a structural symptom of capitalistic reinforcement**, not unlike a planetary orbit deepening into a gravity well.

Thus, our empirical findings do more than guide portfolio construction. They challenge how we:
- Model efficiency in capital markets
- Measure welfare in society
- Justify inequality under modern capitalism


## Conclusion

> **The Matthew Effect is not just a biblical principle—it is a lived, structural condition of our financial and social reality.**

The capital markets amplify this dynamic, and unless counterbalanced by social, policy, or philosophical intervention, it threatens not only equity, but long-term stability and collective welfare.


## Appendix: ME5 PRIOR Portfolios

In this report, I examined the persistence of momentum **within the top market-cap group (ME5)** using the Fama-French 25 Portfolios sorted by size and prior return. Specifically, I analyzed how the performance of five portfolios (PRIOR1 to PRIOR5), sorted by prior 11-month returns within the ME5 group, has evolved between two distinct market regimes: pre-2010 and post-2010.

The results are striking.

> Even among the largest companies (top 20% by market cap), those that performed best over the prior year continued to outperform in the next month—both in the pre and post-2010 market regime.

What initially seemed like a behavioral or statistical curiosity turns out to reflect a deeper transformation of the market's internal structure—a transformation where **capital flows, visibility, and narrative dominance** now reinforce past winners among the already-rich. In this setting, the language of **freedom, fairness, and opportunity**—so essential to liberal democracy—becomes less about equal access and more about locked-in advantage. The market becomes a mirror, not of fair competition, but of **Matthew Effect dynamics**, where “to those who have, more shall be given.”

For risk-aware investors engaged in short-term, monthly rebalancing, the implications are concrete:

- **PRIOR3** offers exceptional consistency with lower volatility and downside exposure
- **PRIOR5** delivers superior absolute return with tolerable risk
- Both are based on **highly liquid, mega-cap stocks**, making them operationally feasible and institutionally scalable

> In short: **Even among the richest firms, past winners tend to keep winning.**  
> Momentum is no longer a temporary anomaly. It is part of the architecture.

This realization challenges equilibrium-based pricing models and calls into question our normative assumptions about economic fairness. If capital accumulates in a non-reverting way among the already-powerful, **mobility collapses**—and with it, the utilitarian social welfare that undergirds Arrow's idealized world of dynamic fairness. What remains is a hollow pendulum: a financial system that swings, but never truly balances.

### Methodology

We compute a comprehensive set of performance metrics (e.g., annualized return, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Omega, expected CRRA utility) for each ME5 PRIOR portfolio across two structural periods:

- **Pre-2010**: January 1996 to December 2009
- **Post-2010**: January 2010 to December 2023

All returns are monthly and expressed as decimals (net of compounding). Metrics are calculated for value-weighted portfolios of NYSE-listed firms within ME5, using prior 11-month cumulative returns (excluding the most recent month) to define momentum quintiles.

### Empirical Summary and Interpretation

- **Pre-2010**:  
  - **PRIOR4 (moderate momentum)** was most effective for risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 0.66, Sortino 0.94)  
  - **PRIOR5** had higher return, but more volatility and negative skew  
  - **PRIOR1** severely underperformed (negative average return, deep drawdowns)

- **Post-2010**:  
  - Momentum dominance intensifies  
  - **PRIOR5** exhibits top raw returns (13.7%), Sortino (1.41), and CRRA utility  
  - **PRIOR3** shows best Sharpe (0.91) and second lowest volatility (15%)  
  - Both dominate the risk-return landscape with resilience and predictability

The market is no longer cyclical, but **directional**; no longer egalitarian, but **reinforcing**. Passive capital flows, QE-induced yield suppression, and index-based exposure collectively sustain a regime where "winners win more, losers lag longer." If the ideal of equal opportunity was once the balancing pendulum of a free market society, the modern financial system now swings in only one direction.
