In reality, the capital system begins to resemble a **rigged equilibrium**, where the initial balance is illusionary—**a symbolic counterweight with no real effect.**\n\n\n## The Philosophical Lens: Arrow, Spinoza, and Pascal\n\nArrow’s utilitarian social welfare framework assumes at least some degree of fairness and fluidity among agents. But in a setting of structural inequality and declining mobility:\n\n- The **expected utility** of society does not necessarily increase, even if total capital grows\n- The **bottom half** of society may experience **static or declining utility**, overwhelmed by the persistent rise of the elite\n\nFrom a **Spinozist** viewpoint, this is a failure of a rational, self-sustaining society—it lacks balance and cohesion. For **Pascal**, it raises the existential irony of a system designed for all, yet serving few.\n\nAnd if we apply **Rawls' difference principle**, we see an institutional failure to justify inequality based on benefit to the least advantaged. Liberal democracy, viewed from the perspective of **financial capitalism**, begins to fracture: the ideals of liberty, fairness, and equality become ceremonial rather than structural.\n\n\n## Toward a New Interpretation of Market Performance\n\nIn light of this, the ME5 PRIOR5 outperformance is no longer just a quantitative anomaly or a smart strategy. It is a signal—**a structural symptom of capitalistic reinforcement**, not unlike a planetary orbit deepening into a gravity well.\n\nThus, our empirical findings do more than guide portfolio construction. They challenge how we:\n- Model efficiency in capital markets\n- Measure welfare in society\n- Justify inequality under modern capitalism\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n> **The Matthew Effect is not just a biblical principle—it is a lived, structural condition of our financial and social reality.**\n\nThe capital markets amplify this dynamic, and unless counterbalanced by social, policy, or philosophical intervention, it threatens not only equity, but long-term stability and collective welfare.\n\n\n## Appendix: ME5 PRIOR Portfolios\n\nIn this report, I examined the persistence of momentum **within the top market-cap group (ME5)** using the Fama-French 25 Portfolios sorted by size and prior return. Specifically, I analyzed how the performance of five portfolios (PRIOR1 to PRIOR5), sorted by prior 11-month returns within the ME5 group, has evolved between two distinct market regimes: pre-2010 and post-2010.\n\nThe results are striking.\n\n> Even among the largest companies (top 20% by market cap), those that performed best over the prior year continued to outperform in the next month—both in the pre and post-2010 market regime.\n\nWhat initially seemed like a behavioral or statistical curiosity turns out to reflect a deeper transformation of the market's internal structure—a transformation where **capital flows, visibility, and narrative dominance** now reinforce past winners among the already-rich. In this setting, the language of **freedom, fairness, and opportunity**—so essential to liberal democracy—becomes less about equal access and more about locked-in advantage. The market becomes a mirror, not of fair competition, but of **Matthew Effect dynamics**, where “to those who have, more shall be given.”\n\nFor risk-aware investors engaged in short-term, monthly rebalancing, the implications are concrete:\n\n- **PRIOR3** offers exceptional consistency with lower volatility and downside exposure\n- **PRIOR5** delivers superior absolute return with tolerable risk\n- Both are based on **highly liquid, mega-cap stocks**, making them operationally feasible and institutionally scalable\n\n> In short: **Even among the richest firms, past winners tend to keep winning.**  \n> Momentum is no longer a temporary anomaly. It is part of the architecture.\n\nThis realization challenges equilibrium-based pricing models and calls into question our normative assumptions about economic fairness. If capital accumulates in a non-reverting way among the already-powerful, **mobility collapses**—and with it, the utilitarian social welfare that undergirds Arrow's idealized world of dynamic fairness. What remains is a hollow pendulum: a financial system that swings, but never truly balances.\n\n### Methodology\n\nWe compute a comprehensive set of performance metrics (e.g., annualized return, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Omega, expected CRRA utility) for each ME5 PRIOR portfolio across two structural periods:\n\n- **Pre-2010**: January 1996 to December 2009\n- **Post-2010**: January 2010 to December 2023\n\nAll returns are monthly and expressed as decimals (net of compounding). Metrics are calculated for value-weighted portfolios of NYSE-listed firms within ME5, using prior 11-month cumulative returns (excluding the most recent month) to define momentum quintiles.\n\n### Empirical Summary and Interpretation\n\n- **Pre-2010**:  \n  - **PRIOR4 (moderate momentum)** was most effective for risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 0.66, Sortino 0.94)  \n  - **PRIOR5** had higher return, but more volatility and negative skew  \n  - **PRIOR1** severely underperformed (negative average return, deep drawdowns)\n\n- **Post-2010**:  \n  - Momentum dominance intensifies  \n  - **PRIOR5** exhibits top raw returns (13.7%), Sortino (1.41), and CRRA utility  \n  - **PRIOR3** shows best Sharpe (0.91) and second lowest volatility (15%)  \n  - Both dominate the risk-return landscape with resilience and predictability\n\nThe market is no longer cyclical, but **directional**; no longer egalitarian, but **reinforcing**. Passive capital flows, QE-induced yield suppression, and index-based exposure collectively sustain a regime where \"winners win more, losers lag longer.\" If the ideal of equal opportunity was once the balancing pendulum of a free market society, the modern financial system now swings in only one direction.\n\n### ME5 PRIOR Performance Comparison\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pandas_datareader.data as pdr\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, kurtosis\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning) # FutureWarning 제거\npd.set_option('display.width', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 15)\n\n# (1) Load Fama-French data\nstart_date = '1996-01-01'\nend_date = '2023-12-31'\n\n# Define evaluation functions\np = 0.005 # 0.5% 월간 수익률 threshold\neta = 3 # CRRA risk-aversion parameter\n\nff = pdr.DataReader(\"25_Portfolios_ME_Prior_12_2\", \"famafrench\", start_date, end_date)\nff_df = ff[0]\n# print(ff[0].columns.tolist())\n\n# (2) Extract ME5 PRIOR portfolios and convert to net return\nme5_prior = pd.DataFrame({\n    'PRIOR1': ff_df['BIG LoPRIOR'],\n    'PRIOR2': ff_df['ME5 PRIOR2'],\n    'PRIOR3': ff_df['ME5 PRIOR3'],\n    'PRIOR4': ff_df['ME5 PRIOR4'],\n    'PRIOR5': ff_df['BIG HiPRIOR'],\n}) / 100  # convert % to net return\n\nme5_prior.index = me5_prior.index.to_timestamp()\n\n# (3) Split: pre-2010 vs post-2010\nsplit_date = pd.to_datetime(\"2010-01-01\")\nme5_prior_pre = me5_prior[me5_prior.index < split_date]\nme5_prior_post = me5_prior[me5_prior.index >= split_date]\n\n# (4) Metric definitions\ndef annualized_return(r): return (1 + r).prod()**(12 / len(r)) -
