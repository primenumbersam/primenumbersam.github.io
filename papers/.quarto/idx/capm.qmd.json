In concentrated markets, dominant firms with **economic moats** [@bustamante2017product] act as principal components, compressing the payoff space. For example, if the **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)** measures this dominance or concentration, then a high HHI signals reliance on few assets, limiting diversification.

These firms use primary-market capital to reinforce moats, distributing profits rather than fostering competition [@hou2006industry].
