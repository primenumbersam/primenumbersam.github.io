# Mathematical Optimality Criteria

What does it truly mean for something to be “best” or “optimal”? In everyday life, we often feel certain that a person or choice is best for us, yet proving this through language or observable evidence can be elusive. We might want to demonstrate our worthiness to those who choose us, hoping to confirm that their choice is optimal, yet an objective proof remains stubbornly out of reach. One might ask: do we need such objective proof for concepts like love, happiness, longing, life’s meaning, or the value of time?

Fortunately, we communicate about such qualitative (often intangible) matters using equally abstract constructs such as “mind.” Likewise, shared social ideas—fairness, common sense, balance—are conveyed through “conscience.” The fact that humans can intuitively exchange these essential yet hard-to-quantify notions is a cornerstone of civilization, propelling both our evolution as individuals and our cultural development. After all, if humanity can wrestle with and find meaning in these high-level qualitative issues, then gradually addressing simpler, quantitative tasks can still enrich our lives in smaller, incremental ways.

One example of such a “simpler” problem is deciding how best to share our time, money, or energy to benefit everyone involved. Though mathematics began historically through practical needs—like levying taxes—it evolved into a powerful, logical, and straightforward language for describing and analyzing quantitative data. Its synergy with physics is especially strong, as physics studies how physical objects, each with potentially unique measurable characteristics, move and interact. While physics discovers principles inductively—by observation and experiment—mathematics expresses these principles deductively, based on foundational axioms that we regard as truths by definition. If we compare scientific work to making a film, physicists, scientists, and engineers are akin to the actors, directors, and crew, actively shaping production. Mathematicians, by contrast, are like scriptwriters, offering structured descriptions of nature’s quantitative underpinnings without necessarily commenting on deeper philosophical significance.

In mathematics, “best” and “optimal” can vary subtly across subfields. However, the notion of optimization stems from a common principle: if we treat a collection of possible choices as a set, then use equations and inequalities to impose an ordering or structure, we can define criteria (or measures) to determine which choice ranks highest. Before exploring this structural principle in detail, we might start with the fundamental definition of a function—arguably the bedrock of mathematical language.

Mathematics predominantly uses many-to-one (functional) mappings rather than one-to-many relationships. This reflects the view that multiple factors (causes) can lead to one result or outcome, whereas a single cause branching into many unrelated outcomes is less standard in mathematical frameworks. Likewise, when constructing mathematical objects like the set of natural numbers, one defines them not by a ready-made infinite collection, but through repeated binary operations that start with a single, simple idea—merging 1 (countable) and 0 (uncountable) into a coherent, infinite system. Humans find this approach practical, just as societies typically see themselves as collections of individuals, rather than individuals as byproducts of a preexisting society.

From there, optimization problems in mathematics often begin with univariate functions, where each input corresponds uniquely to an output, and measure is introduced through norms—formal ways to quantify “distance.” In a single real dimension, distance is simply an absolute value reflecting differences in magnitude. Extending this to multivariate functions means allowing relationships among elements of possibly different sets, but still mapped in a many-to-one fashion. Such expansions hinge on how “distance” is defined: the familiar Euclidean norm, governed by the Pythagorean theorem, forms the most natural choice for many physical or geometric applications. In Euclidean space, straight lines may be expressed through convex combinations, and circles form the basis for measuring length, area, and volume. In more advanced terminology, geometry calls such environments L2-normed or Hilbert spaces, while statistics interprets them via mean squared error or standard deviation.

Viewed this way, the concept of “optimality” in mathematics is an elegant, if specialized, extension of everyday intuitions about what constitutes “best.” It takes our intuition—emotional and subjective as it may be—and provides a rigorous, quantitative framework for deciding how to **measure**, **compare**, and ultimately **select** the best elements among various alternatives. By situating these decisions within **carefully defined norms and axioms**, mathematical optimization offers a powerful language for navigating the world’s **simpler**, yet still consequential, quantitative puzzles.

### Is it okay to use the word “Optimal”?

과연 현실과 너무 괴리된 모형의 해를 ‘최적’이라 불러도 되는가?

Calling a mathematically derived outcome “optimal” can be misleading when the underlying model’s assumptions differ significantly from real-world conditions. In economics and management, “optimal solution” has become a fixture of academic tradition, referring to the best possible outcome given the model’s internal constraints. Researchers often acknowledge that this solution is “optimal” only within a simplified or idealized framework, yet the term can create confusion outside scholarly circles if it is taken to mean absolute optimality in reality. The distinction between positive and normative statements further complicates matters: models intended for descriptive accuracy (positive) may fail if their assumptions deviate too far from observable data, while models aimed at policy prescriptions (normative) risk overconfidence if they ignore real-world political, ethical, or institutional limitations. Despite these issues, established textbooks and decades of usage have cemented “optimal solution” in the literature, and while alternatives like “model-based optimum” or “stationary path” can highlight a model’s limited scope, they remain less common in mainstream economic and managerial discourse. **“the best feasible path only under given assumptions”**
