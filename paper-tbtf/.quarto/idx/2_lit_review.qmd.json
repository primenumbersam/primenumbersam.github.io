Concentration of capital and returns parallels macro trends in labor share decline and superstar firm dominance [@autor2020fall].\n\nThese findings frame market returns not as compensation for risk, but as *rents accruing to structural position within the capital hierarchy*.\n\n## Positioning TBTF within the Literature\n\nThis study contributes to this emerging paradigm by introducing:\n\n- **Rank-based capital lock-in** frameworks via percentile transition matrices, inspired by social mobility models.\n- A **low-turnover, high-performance TBTF strategy**, rooted in capital persistence rather than information efficiency.\n- A **critique of post-QE capital dynamics**, where ETF-driven flows reinforce rank-based inequality in financial markets.\n\nIn contrast to conventional pricing models assuming rapid mean-reversion and marginal arbitrage, the TBTF strategy illustrates how **capital stratification can sustain excess returns** through structural mechanisms rather than informational edges.\n\nIts continued success does not reject modern finance—it reflects its breakdown under structural stress, necessitating models that account for capital rigidity, transition asymmetry, and institutional drift."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"2_lit_review.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
