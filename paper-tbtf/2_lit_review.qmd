## Classical Foundations of Risk-Based Asset Pricing

Modern finance rests on the principle that asset returns compensate for exposure to systematic risk. Foundational models such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the Fama-French factor models, and the Betting Against Beta (BAB) framework formalize this idea under assumptions of frictionless trading, rational expectations, and arbitrage-free equilibria.

In CAPM, expected returns scale linearly with market beta. The Fama-French Three- and Five-Factor models extend this by incorporating size, value, investment, and profitability factors [@FamaFrench1993; @FamaFrench2015]. Alternative models such as Black–Litterman [@black1992global] or Bayesian tilting [@brandt2009parametric] adjust this equilibrium using investor views. Despite their theoretical elegance, these frameworks rely heavily on *convex market structure*, *homogeneous expectations*, and *efficient capital mobility* — conditions increasingly absent in post-crisis financial markets.

## Empirical Challenges and Structural Frictions

### Factor Models and Fragility Under Structural Shifts

The empirical performance of multi-factor models is often weak out-of-sample. Applying Fama-MacBeth regressions [@FamaMacBeth1973] to industry or quantile portfolios reveals unstable betas, multicollinearity among explanatory variables, and residual alpha persistence [@FamaFrench1997]. Recent replication studies (e.g., @hou2020replicating) show that most anomalies lack robustness, particularly when controlling for micro-cap bias and rebalancing frictions.

Even advanced selection methods, such as Lasso or Ridge-regularized regressions [@Kozak2020], identify few stable predictors. These results suggest that the dominant source of return variation may lie outside the domain of classical factor structures.

### Nonlinearity and the Failure of Beta as a Pricing Kernel

The BAB model posits that low-beta portfolios offer higher Sharpe ratios after adjusting for leverage constraints [@FrazziniPedersen2014]. However, empirical tests using SIC-based portfolios reveal a *non-monotonic relationship*: optimal risk-adjusted returns often cluster around beta ≈ 1, contradicting the implication of continuous beta-based mispricing. This points to *risk inertia* rather than reward for bearing volatility.

### Practical Limitations of Optimization-Based Portfolios

Mean-Variance optimization [@Markowitz1952] and its extensions frequently fail in practice. Portfolio weights are unstable and overfit, leading to high turnover and inferior real-world performance [@DeMiguel2009]. Constrained variants reduce instability but underperform simple passive benchmarks like SPY or QQQ.

### Post-2010 Failures of Predictive Allocation

Dynamic asset allocation models using Bayesian tilting or factor timing [@brandt2009parametric] show limited edge post-2010. In regimes dominated by *non-Gaussian returns*, *policy shocks*, and *arbitrage limits*, these models fail to anticipate structural capital movements or benefit from persistent factor exposures.

## Structural Interpretations: Rent Extraction and Capital Lock-in

A growing literature interprets return generation as increasingly governed by *non-risk factors* such as *capital scale*, *policy insulation*, and *rank persistence*:

- Large banks exhibit lower risk-adjusted returns, suggestive of implicit guarantees [@gandhi2015size].
- Small-cap segments contain a rising share of "zombie" firms — structurally unproductive entities sustained by policy support [@Acharya2024].
- ETF flows bias price discovery toward large-cap incumbents [@jiang2020passive; @Glosten2021].
- Concentration of capital and returns parallels macro trends in labor share decline and superstar firm dominance [@autor2020fall].

These findings frame market returns not as compensation for risk, but as *rents accruing to structural position within the capital hierarchy*.

## Positioning TBTF within the Literature

This study contributes to this emerging paradigm by introducing:

- **Rank-based capital lock-in** frameworks via percentile transition matrices, inspired by social mobility models.
- A **low-turnover, high-performance TBTF strategy**, rooted in capital persistence rather than information efficiency.
- A **critique of post-QE capital dynamics**, where ETF-driven flows reinforce rank-based inequality in financial markets.

In contrast to conventional pricing models assuming rapid mean-reversion and marginal arbitrage, the TBTF strategy illustrates how **capital stratification can sustain excess returns** through structural mechanisms rather than informational edges.

Its continued success does not reject modern finance—it reflects its breakdown under structural stress, necessitating models that account for capital rigidity, transition asymmetry, and institutional drift.
