Covariance stationarity and cointegration describe different statistical properties of time series data. **Covariance stationarity** applies to series where **mean, variance, and autocovariance do not change over time**, while **cointegration** describes cases where **non-stationary ($I(1)$) time series maintain a stable long-run equilibrium**. This study explores how these concepts relate and how **cointegration allows for non-stationary series to form stationary linear combinations**.

## Integration Order

The **integration order** of a time series determines how many times it must be **differenced** to become **stationary**. A series is:

- **I(0) (stationary)** if it has a constant mean, variance, and autocovariance.
- **I(1) (unit root process)** if it is non-stationary but becomes stationary after first differencing.
- **I(d)** if it requires $d$ differences to become stationary.

Economic time series such as **GDP, money supply, and asset prices** often exhibit **I(1) behavior**, meaning they contain **stochastic trends** and require differencing to achieve **stationarity**.

## Joint Covariance Stationarity vs. Cointegration

**Joint covariance stationarity** applies when each time series maintains a **constant mean, variance, and autocovariance** over time. **Cointegration**, on the other hand, describes cases where two or more **non-stationary (I(1))** series share a **long-term equilibrium**, forming a **stationary linear combination**.

### Joint Covariance Stationary Series (Weak-Sense Stationarity)

A set of time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are **jointly covariance stationary** if they satisfy:

1. **Constant Mean**: $E[X_t] = \mu_X$, $E[Y_t] = \mu_Y$ for all $t$.
2. **Constant Variance**: $Var(X_t)$ and $Var(Y_t)$ do not change over time.
3. **Autocovariance Depends Only on Lag**: $Cov(X_t, X_{t-h})$ and $Cov(Y_t, Y_{t-h})$ depend only on the lag $h$, not on $t$.

If two time series are both **weakly stationary**, then any **linear combination** of them is also stationary.

### Cointegrated Series

A set of time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are **cointegrated** if:

1. Each series is **I(1) (non-stationary)**.
2. A **linear combination exists** that is **I(0) (stationary)**:

   $$
   \beta_1 X_t + \beta_2 Y_t = u_t
   $$

where $u_t$ is **$I(0)$ (stationary)**.

Thus, **even though individual variables are non-stationary, their linear combination is stationary**, implying a **long-run equilibrium relationship**.

### The Relationship Between Covariance Stationarity and Cointegration

| Property | Joint Covariance Stationary Series | Cointegrated Series |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Stationarity** | Each series is stationary (I(0)) | Each series is non-stationary (I(1)), but a linear combination is stationary |
| **Unit Root (I(d))** | I(0) for each series | I(1) for each series, but a specific linear combination is I(0) |
| **Mean & Variance Stability** | Mean & variance are constant over time | Individual series do not have stable mean & variance, but the combination does |
| **Long-run Relationship** | No long-term relationship constraint | A long-run equilibrium relationship exists |

#### Cointegrated Series Can Be Transformed into Covariance Stationary Series
If $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are **cointegrated**, their first differences $\Delta X_t$, $\Delta Y_t$ (or the residual $u_t$) are stationary.

- The **error correction term** \( u_t \) is stationary \( I(0) \), meaning it satisfies the covariance stationarity conditions.

#### Joint Covariance Stationary Series Are Not Cointegrated
If $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are both **already $I(0)$ (stationary)**, then any linear combination of them is also stationary.

- They cannot be cointegrated because cointegration only applies to non-stationary (I(1)) series.
- If all series are already covariance stationary, testing for cointegration is unnecessary.

## Implications for Empirical Analysis

- Before testing for cointegration, check for stationarity. If all series are I(0), cointegration does not apply.
- If series are cointegrated, their residuals (error correction term) should be covariance stationary.
- Many macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP & consumption, money supply & inflation) are cointegrated rather than purely covariance stationary.
