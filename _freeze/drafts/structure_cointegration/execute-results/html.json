Using monthly data from 1990 to 2024, we apply standard unit root and cointegration tests (e.g., Johansen, Engle-Granger), followed by structural break detection methods including the Bai-Perron test and rolling Johansen estimation. The study extends the analysis to fractional and threshold cointegration frameworks to capture long-memory properties and regime-dependent adjustments. Empirical findings suggest that cointegration relationships among economic variables are not stable over time and tend to shift around major macroeconomic shocks. This result highlights the importance of accounting for structural nonstationarities in economic modeling and long-term forecasting.\nkeywords: Long-Run Equilibrium, Cointegration, Time-Varying Parameter, Structural Breaks, Regime Shift, \nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    toc: true\njupyter: python3\n---\n\n\n## 1. Research Overview\n\nThis study investigates whether key U.S. economic indicators exhibit **time-varying cointegration** and how structural breaks affect their long-run relationships. The analysis aims to:\n\n- Identify **which variables are cointegrated** in the long term.\n- Track **how these relationships evolve** over time.\n- Detect and interpret **structural breaks** in equilibrium relationships.\n- Extend beyond traditional models by using **fractional and threshold cointegration** frameworks.\n\n\n## 2. Preliminaries\n\n- **Spurious correlation vs. Cointegration**: High correlation between non-stationary variables may be misleading unless the variables are cointegrated.\n- **Cointegration**: A linear combination of I(1) variables that is stationary (I(0)) implies a stable long-term equilibrium.\n- **Interpretation**: Variables sharing a cointegration relationship tend to move together over time, despite individual stochastic trends.\n- **Empirical Rule**: In long-term data (e.g., >10 years), a correlation coefficient > 0.7 between I(1) series may suggest stable equilibrium.\n- **Nelson & Plosser (1982)**: U.S. macroeconomic series often follow stochastic trends, cautioning against naive regression without testing for cointegration.\n\n\n\n## 3. Research Questions\n\n1. Which economic indicators form long-term relationships?\n2. How have these relationships changed over time?\n3. Do identified structural breaks correspond to major economic shocks (e.g., 2008, COVID-19, inflation)?\n\n\n\n## 4.
