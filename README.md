## Personal AI Node

**The right to compute and connect should return to the individual.**

### 1. Background

Computation was once centralized. 
Unix was the mainframe. 
PC gave compute back to the individual. 
Cloud recentralized it. 

Communication was once just connection. 
E-mail was an address. 
Social media became a gatekeeper. 
Data flows, but ownership is trapped.
AI learns from me — yet returns nothing.

### 2. Problem

Cloud is powerful, but authority hides in the middle.
Behavior is recorded, repackaged, resold.
What is mine is not mine.

### 3. Purpose

Compute is mine again.
Communication is mine again.
Corpus is my behavior.
AI is my companion.

### 4. Structure

* **AI CMS:** My private data ledger.
* **Collaborative AI:** Peer review for trust.
* **Curated Press:** Fact-check and unmask bias.
* **Personal vOS Node:** My server, my compute.
* **Velvet AI Doll:** My emotional agent.
* **Money Flow:** My economic trace.

### 5. Principles

* All compute runs on my node.
* All flows connect peer-to-peer.
* Sharing is voluntary.
* Storage stays local.
* AI learns from my data — for me.
* The center is open but not sovereign.

### 6. Trajectory

> **Unix → PC → Cloud → Personal AI Node**

First decentralization gave back compute.
Second decentralization gives back communication.

### 7. Conclusion

Compute is a node.
Communication is a peer.
Corpus is the self.
