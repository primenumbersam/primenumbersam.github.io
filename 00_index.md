title: "Labor-Capital Dynamics in the Age of Automation"
abstract: This study constructs a nonlinear dynamical model to investigate the structural separation of capital from labor under conditions of automation, declining reinvestment, and elite saturation. Drawing from the ecological foundations of Lotka–Volterra systems and their reinterpretation in Goodwin-type class dynamics, we estimate time-varying parameters using U.S. wealth share data from 1989 to 2024. The empirical analysis reveals a persistent erosion of labor's structural role, not only among the general population but also within the most capital-intensive strata. A calibrated system with minimally positive transmission from labor to capital is sufficient to sustain realistic long-run dynamics, while full disconnection leads to terminal decay of capital itself. These results challenge conventional interpretations of equilibrium and redistribution, suggesting that economic survival is less about moral desert and more about positional geometry. The study concludes by proposing a normative framework for economic system design, where structural resilience and ethical intervention are understood as functions of dynamic curvature.

## Highlights

- Introduces a nonlinear dynamical model where capital can persist or collapse depending on minimal structural links to labor, calibrated on U.S. top-percentile wealth share data (1989–2024).

- Shows that automation-led capital growth, without sufficient labor coupling, leads to systemic extinction—even for elite capital holders—revealing a degenerate equilibrium regime.

- Reinterprets economic equilibrium not as a sign of fairness or efficiency, but as a geometric endpoint of exclusion, calling for ethical intervention based on structural curvature.

## Literature Review

The conceptual bridge between ecological modeling and economic dynamics has a long and diverse intellectual history. Scholars have long recognized the analogical power of predator–prey systems to model distributional conflict and endogenous cycles in capitalist economies. Among the earliest and most influential contributions is Richard Goodwin's canonical growth-cycle model, which adapted Lotka–Volterra equations to represent the cyclical interaction between labor and capital classes. In Goodwin’s formulation, wage–employment dynamics form closed orbits where labor bargaining power rises during economic expansion but erodes as profits fall, ultimately triggering contraction and a return to low employment and suppressed wages. This framework, originally presented in @goodwin1967, has since become foundational in heterodox macroeconomics.

Subsequent work by @grasselli2012goodwin has expanded the Goodwin framework to include Keynesian demand channels, monetary effects, and fiscal policy. Notably, @ploeg1987monetary incorporated inflationary dynamics, offering insights into how money supply and interest rates can modulate the amplitude and persistence of labor–capital cycles. These extensions preserved the endogenous nature of business cycles while recognizing the increasingly complex institutional features of modern economies.

Earlier mathematical developments that inspired such economic analogies include the pioneering biological systems of @lotka1925elements and @volterra1926fluctuations, who independently developed foundational population dynamics models now widely known as Lotka–Volterra equations. The predator–prey metaphor embedded in these models proved to be a powerful tool not only in ecology but also in macroeconomic theory. Subsequent refinements by @rosenzweig1963graphical highlighted conditions under which these systems achieve stable equilibria, a property heavily exploited in economic analogs to model endogenous oscillations.

However, the introduction of technological change into these frameworks has been relatively limited and often stylized. Early efforts, such as those by @shah1981technical, introduced labor-augmenting productivity growth as an exogenous shock, leaving the fundamental structure of labor–capital dependency intact. More recent models, including @tavani2015endogenous, endogenize technological innovation within the Goodwin framework, showing how distributional conflict and profit dynamics can shape the trajectory of technological adoption. Yet, these studies maintain the assumption that capital ultimately requires labor input for accumulation to occur.

By contrast, mainstream approaches to automation and technological displacement—particularly those influenced by general equilibrium theory—have largely developed in isolation from the ecological modeling tradition. The work of @acemoglu2018race and @acemoglu2020wrong is exemplary in this regard. Their task-based models highlight the dual impact of automation: displacing labor in existing tasks while generating productivity gains in newly automated sectors. However, their framework remains rooted in neoclassical optimization and equilibrium concepts, abstracting from nonlinear dynamical interactions.

Several scholars have investigated the longer-term distributional consequences of automation using overlapping generations (OLG) and DSGE models. For instance, @benzell2015robots simulate scenarios in which automation induces rising inequality and stagnant wages, particularly when redistributive policies are insufficiently aggressive. Similarly, @berg2018future adopt a structural macroeconomic approach to evaluate robot-driven labor market shifts, focusing on aggregate demand effects and wage depression. Yet neither approach investigates whether automation permits the structural decoupling of capital from labor—a scenario where capital can self-reproduce independent of labor input.

Piketty’s magisterial study @piketty2014capital brought renewed attention to the structural persistence of inequality, emphasizing the importance of long-term returns to capital exceeding the growth rate of the economy (r > g). While his analysis focuses on empirical documentation of wealth concentration trends and the redistributive implications, it leaves open the question of how such structures emerge dynamically from micro- or meso-level interaction rules.

The philosophical underpinnings of capital–labor relations were of course prefigured in @marx1867kapital, who viewed capital as a historically specific form of social relation dependent on the extraction of surplus labor. However, our approach departs from Marx’s value-theoretic method by emphasizing nonlinear dynamics, system trajectories, and bifurcation behavior. Rather than analyzing exploitation in terms of exchange or surplus value, we treat the labor–capital relation as an evolving system whose equilibrium properties—and possible pathologies—arise endogenously from the structure of interaction.

A key innovation in our study lies in adapting dynamic system analysis to accommodate time-varying parameters, drawing inspiration from recent work in applied mathematics and systems ecology. The replicator dynamics literature (e.g., evolutionary game theory) provides a formal bridge, with roots traceable to @hofbauer1998evolutionary and the stability criteria derived from the Jacobian of the system near equilibrium. The economic interpretation of such structures has been extended by authors like @flaschel2009macrodynamics and @sportelli1995technological, who examine how changes in capital intensity or wage bargaining affect the cyclical behavior of economic systems.

Our contribution diverges from this lineage by considering the possibility that technological change does not merely shift parameter values but **alters the structural topology of the system itself**. In particular, we allow for capital to accumulate autonomously, decoupled from labor, through an automation-driven growth coefficient. This extension yields a degenerate equilibrium where labor disappears from the system without triggering capital collapse—a phase-space configuration that prior models do not accommodate.

This potential for structural labor extinction resonates with speculative visions found in popular discourse and policy research. For example, @sachs2015smart and @susskind2020future warn that technological automation could render human labor economically obsolete. However, their analyses are largely qualitative or comparative-static, lacking the dynamical modeling apparatus required to assess transition paths or threshold behaviors.

In summary, our work synthesizes multiple strands of thought—ecological modeling, dynamic systems theory, and labor economics—to propose a novel framework for understanding how technological change interacts with capital–labor relations. By modeling automation as an explicit channel for capital self-replication, we open the possibility of equilibrium outcomes in which capital persists without labor. This represents a fundamental departure from the assumptions underlying both neoclassical and Marxian traditions and invites a rethinking of what it means for an economic system to be structurally just, dynamically viable, and ethically acceptable.
