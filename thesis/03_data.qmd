# Data

- Pooled Panel data
- Panel data

- CRSP from WRDS
- price data from Yahoo Finance
- Fama-French data library
- FRED database

## Appendix: Top 10 permno (시트-샘플)


### Footnote : CRSP monthly data의 'date'를 월말 날짜로 변환
In CRSP monthly stock data, dates like "2010-04-01" typically represent the end-of-month data, such as the market price on 2010-04-30, not the start of the month.

Adjust CRSP dates (e.g., 2020-01-01) to month-end (e.g., 2020-01-31) to match regular (e.g. Yahoo Finance) resampled dates.

df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])+ pd.offsets.MonthEnd(0)

### Fama-French SMB 구성 규칙: 

이전 해 12월 말(예: 2000년 12월) 시점에서 NYSE의 median 시가총액을 기준으로 Small과 Big의 경계선이 결정. 실제로 포트폴리오를 구성하는 시점은 그 다음 해 6월 말 (예: 2001년 6월 말). 

- 6개월의 시간 차이를 둔 것은 실무적으로 연말 결산 데이터와 회계자료(book equity 등)의 발표와 확인, 데이터베이스화 과정이 약 4~6개월 정도 소요되기 때문.
- Fama-French의 초기 연구(1992, 1993, 1996년 등)에 따르면, 시가총액(market equity) 기준의 기업 순위(percentile rank)는 대체로 상당히 지속적(persistent)이며, 6개월 이내에 급격하게 변동하는 기업은 상대적으로 적었다고 함.

예시:

- 이전 해 12월 말에 10 percentile 이상이었고 (당시 큰 편에 속했지만),
- 그 다음 해 6월 말에 측정된 시가총액이 NYSE median market equity보다 작다면(즉 50 percentile 이하라면),
- 실제로 포트폴리오에 편입될 때는 Small 그룹으로 분류됩니다.

### 2010-01-01 as the Split Point

The segmentation of financial time-series data at **2010-01-01** enables a clear distinction between two fundamentally different economic regimes. The **pre-2010 period** is characterized by financial deregulation, crises, and heightened volatility, while the **post-2010 period** reflects policy-driven recovery, evolving geopolitical risks, technological transformations, and the **popularization of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**. This division enhances the robustness of empirical analysis, allowing for a **comparative assessment of portfolio performance across distinct macroeconomic environments**.

#### Segmentation of Time-Series Data

The dataset analyzed in this study spans **1996-01-01 to 2023-12-31** with a **monthly frequency**. To assess portfolio performance across different economic conditions, the time series is divided at **2010-01-01**, creating two equal sub-periods:
- **1996-01-01 to 2009-12-31** (14 years)
- **2010-01-01 to 2023-12-31** (14 years)

This segmentation aligns with major financial and macroeconomic shifts, particularly the **aftermath of the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis**, which ushered in a new era of monetary policy and market behavior, as well as the **rise in popularity and widespread adoption of ETFs**.

#### Rationale for Selecting 2010-01-01

The **pre-2010 period** was marked by high financial volatility, including the **Asian Financial Crisis (1997)**, **Dot-com Bubble (2000-2001)**, **9/11 attacks (2001)**, and **Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009)**. These events significantly influenced market structures and investment dynamics.

Conversely, the **post-2010 period** saw a **shift towards policy-driven markets**, with extensive **Quantitative Easing (QE)** programs, **U.S.-China trade tensions (2018)**, the **COVID-19 pandemic (2020)**, the **rise of AI-driven market trends (2023-present)**, and the **proliferation of ETFs as a mainstream investment vehicle**. This transition underscores the fundamental differences between the two periods in terms of risk exposure, liquidity conditions, technological advancements, and investment strategies.

By segmenting the data at **2010-01-01**, this study enables a structured analysis of how portfolio performance responds to **structurally distinct economic environments**, enhancing the robustness of financial research.

## Appendix: Key Events in Each Period

The following table outlines **major macroeconomic and financial events** that influenced global markets during each period. The **relative importance** of each event is indicated in parentheses (e.g., *Very High*, *High*).
