title: "Too Big to Fail?"
subtitle: The Sadly Optimal Portfolio Strategy
abstract: This paper investigates how post-2008 Federal Reserve policies, ETF proliferation, and passive capital flows have fundamentally altered the structure of U.S. financial markets. Empirical evidence reveals that stock return distributions have become increasingly asymmetric and persistent, resembling a mixture of heterogeneous assets under arbitrage limits—challenging the assumptions of efficient markets and no-arbitrage pricing. At the center of this shift lies the “Too Big to Fail” (TBTF) portfolio strategy, which selects the ten largest market-cap stocks and applies a convex internal weighting scheme. Since 2010, this simple strategy has delivered superior risk-adjusted performance relative to standard benchmarks. However, its success appears to stem not from superior fundamentals, but from structural inefficiencies, capital lock-in, and policy-induced concentration. The study highlights a paradox — the TBTF strategy is “sadly optimal” — profitable when inefficiencies persist, but socially desirable only when it fails. The findings raise broader concerns about the erosion of market competition, allocative efficiency, and the long-term consequences of intervention-driven financial capitalism.

## Key Highlights

> Too big to fail? More like too big to be good, too big for justice, and too big to not exploit.

- **Structural Market Distortions and Return Asymmetry**  
  Post-2008 policies have induced persistent capital flows toward dominant firms while allowing unproductive small-cap firms to survive via liquidity support, resulting in asymmetric return distributions and distorted risk–return profiles.

- **The TBTF Strategy as a Diagnostic Tool**  
  A simple portfolio of the top 10 market-cap stocks outperforms traditional benchmarks across multiple performance metrics. However, its success reflects structural capital lock-in and systemic inefficiencies rather than superior risk pricing or fundamentals.

- **A Paradox of Optimality and Inefficiency**  
  The TBTF strategy remains optimal as long as inefficiencies persist. If it fails, it may signal a return to efficient markets. Thus, investors profit from distortions that are socially and economically suboptimal.

- **Implications for Asset Pricing and Market Design**  
  The findings call for new asset pricing models that incorporate rank-based capital dynamics, asymmetric transition probabilities, and non-ergodic behavior—moving beyond equilibrium-based risk-return tradeoffs.
