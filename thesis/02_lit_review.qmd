# Literature Review

## 1. Classical Theories of Risk-Based Asset Pricing  

Traditional financial economics posits that expected returns serve as compensation for bearing systematic risk. This principle underpins several foundational models:
- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) asserts that expected excess returns are proportional to market beta.
- The Fama-French Three- and Five-Factor Models extend CAPM by incorporating size, value, profitability, and investment factors [@FamaFrench1993; - @FamaFrench2015].
- The Betting Against Beta (BAB) framework suggests that low-beta assets may outperform on a risk-adjusted basis [@FrazziniPedersen2014].
- Mean-Variance Optimization, introduced by @Markowitz1952, assumes that returns are normally distributed and fully explained by their mean and covariance structure.

These models rest on assumptions of frictionless markets, convex opportunity sets, homogeneous beliefs, and the absence of arbitrage opportunities.

## 2. Empirical Challenges to Risk-Based Models  
Utilizing CRSP monthly data, Fama-French industry portfolios, and ETF benchmarks across pre- and post-2010 periods, this study revisits and challenges these foundational models.

### 2.1 Industry-Level Linear Factor Models and Multicollinearity  
- Multi-Factor Model with Fama-MacBeth Regression [@FamaMacBeth1973]: When applied to industry portfolios, it reveals large, persistent unexplained alphas [@FamaFrench1997] while the market risk premium becomes statistically insignificant. @asness2018size argue that the size premium persists when controlling for quality factors, suggesting the reversal may stem from low-quality small-cap stocks. Additionally, @hou2020replicating find that many documented anomalies, including size-related ones, do not hold up under rigorous testing, while **mitigated** if carefully controlling microcap stocks and using value-weighted returns. For example, excess returns of FF industry portfolios are regressed on macro and financial factors, revealing **multicollinearity** among predictors like market excess returns, value spreads, and volatility indicators, leading to unstable coefficients and weak out-of-sample explanatory power.  
- Lasso regularization confirms model sparsity, with only a few predictors consistently selected, often exhibiting inconsistent signs [@Kozak2020].

### 2.2 Betting Against Beta and Sharpe Ratio Symmetry  
- The BAB Strategy posits that high-beta assets underperform on a risk-adjusted basis [@FrazziniPedersen2014].
- Empirical tests using SIC 10 portfolios reveal that optimal Sharpe ratios are achieved by portfolios with betas close to 1, rather than low or high values. The relationship between beta and performance is either flat or non-monotonic, suggesting that risk exposure is not systematically mispriced but structurally inert.

### 2.3 Practical Failures of Mean-Variance Optimization  
- Unconstrained Mean-Variance (MV) Optimization yields extreme and highly unstable weights, leading to high turnover and poor out-of-sample performance [@DeMiguel2009].
- Imposing constraints (e.g., no short-selling) enhances stability but reduces performance below passive benchmarks. Passive value-weighted portfolios consistently outperform MV portfolios, even when optimized using historical data.

### 2.4 Limitations of Bayesian Optimization and Tilting  
- @black1992global combines CAPM equilibrium with investor views via Bayesian updating.  
- @brandt2009parametric incorporate momentum and size signals into dynamic allocation, but our empirical tests reveal no consistent outperformance over ETF benchmarks post-2010, suffering from estimation error and overfitting in regimes characterized by unstable return distributions.

## 3. Structural Interpretation and Motivation for TBTF  
The underperformance of theoretically sound but empirically fragile strategies suggests capital markets reward position within a segmented system rather than risk. 

- Large-cap firms are insulated from downward transitions, mirroring the 'superstar' effect where small quality differences yield large market outcomes, as described by Rosen [@rosen1981economics]. In banking, @gandhi2015size find large banks have lower risk-adjusted returns, indicative of implicit government guarantees in adverse scenarios.  
- Small-cap firms increasingly comprise structurally inefficient "zombie" entities sustained by liquidity support [@Acharya2024].
- Return distributions no longer reflect efficient risk pricing but are shaped by arbitrage-limited capital flows, ETF-induced inflows, and policy distortions [@Glosten2021; @ShleiferVishny1997].
- Return distributions reflect arbitrage-limited capital flows, ETF-induced inflows, and policy distortions, with @jiang2020passive showing passive investing disproportionately benefits large firms, exacerbating concentration. This aligns with @autor2020fall, linking market power concentration to declining labor share, highlighting structural market dynamics.

These findings motivate rank-based strategies like TBTF, capitalizing on structural capital dynamics rather than informational edges.

## 4. Contributions to the Literature  
This study extends literature on asset pricing anomalies, building on @hou2020replicating.  regarding anomaly robustness. It introduces Markov-based transition models for capital lock-in, aligning with rising concentration insights from @autor2020fall and @jiang2020passive. It offers low-turnover, high-performance portfolio strategies and critiques ETF-driven distortions and post-QE concentration, reflecting real-world finance breakdowns under structural stress.

This study builds upon and extends several strands of the literature:

- Asset Pricing Anomalies: It demonstrates new forms of structural deviation not explained by established factors [@hou2020replicating]
- Market Structure and Capital Mobility: It introduces Markov-based transition models to analyze capital lock-in .
- Portfolio Strategy Design: It offers a low-turnover, high-performance alternative to optimization-based approaches.
- Market Efficiency Critique: It provides empirical support for critiques of ETF-driven distortions and post-QE market concentration [@autor2020fall ; @jiang2020passive].

The TBTF strategy does not reject modern finance but reflects its real-world breakdown under structural stress. Its continued success raises fundamental questions about what financial markets price and for whose benefit.
