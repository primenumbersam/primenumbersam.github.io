This point marks a transition from a period of crisis-driven volatility and deregulation to an era characterized by **policy-dominated asset inflation, ETF proliferation, and asymmetric capital flows**. By segmenting the data at this breakpoint, we aim to assess how financial market performance and capital concentration evolved across two distinct regimes.\n\nThe dataset spans **January 1996 to December 2023**, with a monthly frequency. It is segmented as follows:\n\n- **Pre-2010**: 1996–2009  \n- **Post-2010**: 2010–2023\n\nThe segmentation provides a clean empirical framework to evaluate the impact of structural policy interventions and evolving capital dynamics.\n\n## 2. Historical Context of Each Period\n\n### Pre-2010: Volatility, Deregulation, and Crisis\n\nThe pre-2010 period includes several global shocks and deregulation episodes:\n\n- **1997 Asian Financial Crisis**\n- **Dot-com Bubble and Crash (2000–2001)**\n- **9/11 Terror Attacks (2001)**\n- **Repeal of Glass-Steagall (1999)**, which contributed to systemic risk buildup\n- **Global Financial Crisis (2008–2009)**, culminating in the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the implementation of TARP\n\nThis was an era of market discontinuity, high volatility, and risk repricing, where asset allocation was still driven largely by fundamentals and discretionary investing.\n\n### Post-2010: QE Regime and Capital Lock-In\n\nIn contrast, the post-2010 era reflects a **policy-driven financial environment**, where capital markets were shaped by:\n\n- **Quantitative Easing (QE1, QE2, QE3)**\n- **Passive flows via ETF proliferation**\n- **Technological monopolization**\n- **COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented stimulus**\n- **AI-fueled equity valuations post-2023**\n\nThese changes have amplified top-heavy capital concentration and reinforced inertia in market leadership. Importantly, they enabled the survival of inefficient firms at the lower end (zombie firms), distorting the small-cap return distribution.\n\n## 3. US Top 10 Stability: Empirical Snapshot\n\nAn empirical motivation for the TBTF strategy lies in the historical persistence of top-cap firms. From 2012 to 2023, only **27 unique PERMNOs** appeared in the top 10 by market cap. These include:\n\n- **AAPL**, **MSFT**, **AMZN**, **GOOG**, **META**, **NVDA**, **TSLA**\n- Traditional blue chips like **XOM**, **JNJ**, **WMT**, **JPM**, **BAC**\n- Healthcare and consumer giants like **UNH**, **LLY**, **PG**, **KO**\n- Financials and telcos like **BRK**, **MA**, **V**, **T**, **VZ**\n\nThis concentration implies that capital has become locked into a narrow subset of firms, with little room for new entrants—an observation with profound implications for allocative efficiency and market competition.\n\n## 4.
