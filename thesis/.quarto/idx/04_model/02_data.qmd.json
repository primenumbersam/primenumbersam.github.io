We utilize multiple sources to enable a comprehensive analysis of market structure, return distributions, and benchmark comparisons. The primary dataset is drawn from CRSP, with supplemental reference portfolios and index returns from Fama-French and Yahoo Finance, respectively.\n\n## 1. Primary Data: CRSP Monthly Stock File\n\nWe use the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) monthly stock files from January 1996 to December 2023. The CRSP universe includes all listed common stocks on the NYSE, Nasdaq, and AMEX exchanges. Key variables include:\n\n- **PERMNO**: Unique stock identifier  \n- **Date**: Monthly observation date  \n- **Market Capitalization**: Shares outstanding × price  \n- **primaryexch** : primary exchange\n- **SIC Code**: Optional industry classification  \n\n### Market-Cap Based Valuation Perspective\n\nUnlike fixed-income instruments, public equities derive their economic value primarily from their **tradeability**. While dividends contribute to realized returns, they are secondary to a stock’s **market capitalization path**, which reflects its ability to attract and retain capital under uncertainty.\n\nWe therefore adopt a **market cap–based valuation approach**, using capitalization time series as the core proxy for equity value and flow dynamics.\n\n### Delisting Treatment: Terminal Value = Zero\n\nWhen a stock is delisted:\n\n- Its market capitalization becomes zero, and its final **gross return is set to 0**, implying **net return of –1**.\n\n$$ R_{\\text{gross}} = 0, \\quad R_{\\text{net}} = -1 $$\n\nThis reflects the reality that delisted equities become practically untradeable and lose all resale value for investors. In contrast to fixed-income instruments, equities have no residual recovery claim.\n\n### IPO Treatment: External Entry State\n\n- Newly listed stocks (IPOs) are initially placed in an **external state** (state 0).\n- From their first full month after IPO:\n  - Their market capitalization is ranked within the universe.\n  - They are assigned to a decile group (state 1–10) based on **market cap percentile**.\n\n### Survivorship Bias Adjustment\n\nTo avoid survivorship bias:\n\n- We **retain all stocks**, including those that were delisted during the sample period.\n- This prevents the **overestimation of returns** and misrepresentation of capital mobility that arises from survivor-only datasets.\n\n### State Classification Framework\n\nFor transition matrix estimation and mixture modeling (Section 4), we define the following **percentile-based state mapping**:\n\n| State | Market Cap Percentile Range | Description |\n|--------|------------------------------|-------------|\n| 10     | 90%–100%                     | Top 10% (largest-cap stocks) |\n| 9      | 80%–90%                      |               |\n| ...    | ...                          |               |\n| 1      | 0%–10%                       | Bottom 10% (smallest-cap stocks) |\n| 0      | External                     | Delisted stocks (absorbing state) or IPOs before full inclusion |\n\nThis unconventional but analytically convenient mapping allows for intuitive modeling of:\n\n- **Upward mobility** as a transition to higher state numbers\n- **Capital lock-in** at the top (persistence in State 10)\n- **Exit fragility** for lower states (transition to State 0)\n\n### Structural Implication\n\nThis mapping enables a **semi-absorbing, non-reversible Markov transition model**, where:\n\n- Delisted stocks enter the **absorbing state (0)** permanently.\n- Stocks that remain listed transition among **states 1–10**, based on their market cap percentile ranks at each time $t$.\n- New entrants (IPOs) begin in state 0 and join the ranked universe from their second month onward.\n\nThis design forms the empirical backbone for **transition matrix analysis, mixture decomposition**, and **long-run mobility asymmetry** in Section 4.\n\n\n## 2. Secondary Data Sources\n\n### Fama-French Research Portfolios\n\nFrom the [Ken French Data Library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), we collect the following datasets:\n\n- **ME10 Decile Portfolios**: Used to compare return characteristics between small-cap (`s_10`) and large-cap (`b_10`) portfolios.\n- **ME × PRIOR Portfolios**: Cross-sorted on size (ME) and prior 12-month return momentum. We focus on:\n  - `ME5 PRIOR4`: Large size, high momentum\n  - `ME4 PRIOR3`: Mid size, moderate momentum\n\nThese portfolios are value-weighted, rebalanced annually using NYSE breakpoints, and provided as monthly returns.\n\n### Index and ETF Benchmarks\n\nTo compare TBTF performance with market-traded investment vehicles, we incorporate the following index and ETF data:\n\n- **Pre-2010 Indices** (from Yahoo Finance):\n  - **^NDX** (Nasdaq 100 Index)\n  - **^DJI** (Dow Jones Industrial Average)\n\n- **Post-2010 ETFs**:\n  - **VTI**: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (inception: 2001)\n  - **SPY**: SPDR S&P 500 ETF (inception: 1993)\n  - **QQQ**: Invesco Nasdaq-100 ETF (inception: 1999)\n  - **DIA**: SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (inception: 1998)\n\n\nThe inclusion of these instruments enables direct comparison with passive investment strategies commonly available to retail and institutional investors.\n\n## Appendix {.appendix}\n\n### Data Availability and Frequency\n\n| Dataset                         | Raw data Frequency | Period Covered       | Source                         |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Fama-French ME Decile          | Monthly   | 1963–2023            | Ken French Data Library        |\n| CRSP Monthly Stock File        | Daily   | 1996–2023            | WRDS/CRSP                      |\n| Fama-French ME × PRIOR         | Monthly   | 2010–2023            | Ken French Data Library        |\n| DIA, QQQ, SPY, VTI (ETFs)      | Daily   | 2010–2023    | Yahoo Finance                  |\n| DJIA, NDX (Price Indices)      | Daily   | 1996–2009            | Yahoo Finance                  |\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Data Source and Construction\n\nThis section describes the data used to construct and evaluate the TBTF portfolio strategy.
