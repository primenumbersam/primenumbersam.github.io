In particular, we compare the top and bottom deciles of market capitalization—commonly denoted as `b_10` (large-cap) and `s_10` (small-cap)—using monthly return data spanning from July 1963 to June 2023.\n\nThe data originate from the \"Portfolios Formed on Size (ME)\" dataset provided by the Ken French Data Library. These portfolios, covering NYSE, Nasdaq, and AMEX stocks, are rebalanced annually using NYSE breakpoints and report monthly **value-weighted excess returns**—i.e., returns net of the one-month Treasury bill rate (risk-free return).\n\nFor additional robustness, we construct aggregates (e.g., `s_70`, `s_90`) to represent broader small-cap behavior.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis section evaluates whether large-cap portfolios exhibit systematically superior **risk-adjusted performance** relative to small-cap portfolios. Such a result would support the hypothesis that TBTF-style strategies derive their advantage not from tactical optimization, but from structural features of the cross-sectional return distribution.\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe compare the `s_10` and `b_10` portfolios in three dimensions:\n\n- **Distributional Shape**: via QQ-plots and skewness asymmetry  \n- **Volatility Profile**: through standard deviation comparisons  \n- **Sharpe Ratio Dynamics**: using time-varying rolling Sharpe ratio curves and volatility–mean coordinate plots\n\nUnlike most academic studies that summarize portfolio performance using static points in mean–volatility space, we propose a dynamic framework in which Sharpe ratios are evaluated as time-series objects. This allows us to capture persistent structural asymmetries.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n1. The `b_10` portfolio exhibits consistently lower volatility than `s_10`, across the full 60-year period.\n2. Dynamic Sharpe ratio visualization reveals that the performance advantage of `b_10` is persistent over time, not a byproduct of a particular decade or business cycle.\n3. QQ-plots show that `b_10` excess returns are closer to Gaussian, while `s_10` returns display tail asymmetry—characterized by positive skewness and negative tail risk.\n\nThese results suggest that large-cap portfolios, especially those at the very top of the capitalization spectrum, provide more stable and efficient **excess return profiles**. This supports the structural validity of selecting top-ranked assets by market capitalization in TBTF portfolio construction.\n\n## Sharpe Ratio Dynamics\n\nWhile static comparisons of mean and volatility offer useful summary insights, they can be misleading in the presence of temporal instability. To capture the **time-varying performance profile** of small- and large-cap portfolios, we construct **rolling Sharpe ratios** using annualized excess returns.\n\nLet $\\mu_t$ and $\\sigma_t$ denote the rolling annualized **excess return mean** and **volatility** of a portfolio over a 36-month window. Then, the rolling Sharpe ratio at time $t$ is computed as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Sharpe}_t = \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\sigma_t}\n$$\n\nWe focus on the bottom and top size deciles: `s_10` (small-cap) and `b_10` (large-cap).\n\n### Key Results\n\n- Over the 60-year period, the **unconditional average annual Sharpe ratio** of `b_10` was **0.99**, compared to **0.74** for `s_10`.\n- The time-series of rolling Sharpe ratios reveals that `b_10` **dominates structurally**, not just in isolated windows.\n- During periods of macroeconomic stress, `s_10` portfolios experience sharper volatility spikes, reducing their Sharpe ratios significantly.\n\n![](figs/sharpe_curve_s10_b10.png)\n*Time-series of 36-month rolling Sharpe ratios for `s_10` and `b_10`.

The red horizontal line marks the long-run average (~3.0% annually).*\n\n![](figs/annual_std_diff_s10_b10.png)\n*Annual volatility difference: `s_10 – b_10`.
