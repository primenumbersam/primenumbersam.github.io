{"title":"Too Big to Fail?","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Too Big to Fail?","subtitle":"The Sadly Optimal Portfolio Strategy","abstract":"This paper investigates how post-2008 Federal Reserve policies, ETF proliferation, and passive capital flows have fundamentally altered the structure of U.S. financial markets. Empirical evidence reveals that stock return distributions have become increasingly asymmetric and persistent, resembling a mixture of heterogeneous assets under arbitrage limits—challenging the assumptions of efficient markets and no-arbitrage pricing. At the center of this shift lies the “Too Big to Fail” (TBTF) portfolio strategy, which selects the ten largest market-cap stocks and applies a convex internal weighting scheme. Since 2010, this simple strategy has delivered superior risk-adjusted performance relative to standard benchmarks. However, its success appears to stem not from superior fundamentals, but from structural inefficiencies, capital lock-in, and policy-induced concentration. The study highlights a paradox — the TBTF strategy is “sadly optimal” — profitable when inefficiencies persist, but socially desirable only when it fails. The findings raise broader concerns about the erosion of market competition, allocative efficiency, and the long-term consequences of intervention-driven financial capitalism."},"headingText":"Key Highlights","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n> Too big to fail?
