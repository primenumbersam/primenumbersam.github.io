Together, these effects form a **dual-channel breakdown** in market efficiency.\n\n## The TBTF Strategy and Its Structural Paradox\n\nWithin this environment, we evaluate a simple but powerful portfolio: the **“Too Big to Fail” (TBTF) strategy**. It selects the ten largest firms by market cap from the CRSP universe, applies a convex (quadratic or exponential) weighting scheme, and rebalances at fixed intervals.\n\nDespite its simplicity, the TBTF portfolio delivers **persistent and superior risk-adjusted performance**, especially in the post-2010 regime. It outperforms standard indices and academic benchmarks across multiple metrics while maintaining low turnover. Its success, however, is paradoxical:\n\n> The strategy is optimal only if the market is inefficient.  \n> If it fails, society wins. If it works, structural distortion persists.\n\nThis **“sadly optimal” paradox** reveals that investors can rationally profit from a system that is collectively irrational.\n\n## Capital Mobility, Lock-In, and Structural Polarization\n\nTo uncover the deeper structure, we construct **percentile-based Markov transition matrices** and **stationary capital share distributions**.
