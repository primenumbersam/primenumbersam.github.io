Structural Shifts in Capital Markets\n\nOver the past two decades, U.S. financial markets have undergone a series of profound structural transformations. These changes—accelerated by post-2008 Federal Reserve interventions, the rise of passive investing, and the dominance of a few mega-cap firms—have gradually undermined the foundational assumptions of neoclassical asset pricing models. Most notably, the classical assumptions of global convexity, representative agents, and arbitrage-free pricing appear increasingly misaligned with empirical realities.\n\nContemporary market dynamics no longer conform to the canonical vision of systematic risk being priced efficiently. Instead, capital appears to flow disproportionately toward a small set of dominant firms, driven not by marginal productivity or risk-adjusted returns, but by **network effects, ETF-driven capital flows, and central bank distortions**. These flows exhibit characteristics more consistent with **structural rent allocation** than with traditional risk-based compensation.\n\n## 2. From Risk Pricing to Rent Extraction\n\nThis paper challenges the notion that financial markets primarily reward investors for bearing systematic risk. Instead, it proposes that post-crisis capital markets have evolved into a system of **rent-based pricing**, in which certain firms absorb a growing share of capital inflows due to structural advantage rather than economic fundamentals. This environment favors firms that are **“too big to fail” (TBTF)**—not because they are intrinsically more productive or efficient, but because the market structure allows them to persist at the top through passive flows and low volatility.\n\nThe study investigates whether stock return distributions in the U.S. stock market now resemble a **time-varying mixture of heterogeneous assets under arbitrage-limited dynamics**, as opposed to a homogeneous no-arbitrage equilibrium. The market appears to be governed less by efficient risk sharing and more by **path-dependent capital accumulation**, leading to a form of **structural capital lock-in and asymmetric mobility** across capital ranks.\n\n## 3. Stylized Facts and Hypotheses\n\nThe study is guided by a set of empirical regularities and theoretical conjectures:\n\n- **Return Distributions** have become increasingly asymmetric and exhibit fat tails concentrated in top-cap stocks.\n- **Capital Concentration** is not only extreme in level but persistent in share and rank.\n- **Transition Dynamics** across size ranks show decreasing upward mobility and increasing lock-in duration for top-cap stocks.\n- **Market Efficiency** is being eroded by capital polarization, in which capital increasingly accumulates at the top while the rest of the distribution remains stagnant.\n- **ETFs and QE Policies** act as reinforcing mechanisms, feeding capital into already dominant firms, thereby reducing entropy and distorting allocative efficiency.\n\n## 4. The Dual Distortion of Market Efficiency\n\nImportantly, the distortion of allocative efficiency is not limited to the top end of the market. At the lower end of the capitalization spectrum, another structural problem emerges: the survival and persistence of **zombie firms**—unproductive small-cap companies that continue to operate despite being economically non-viable.\n\nFueled by prolonged low interest rates, government credit guarantees, and liquidity injections, these firms are shielded from market discipline and allowed to persist. As a result, the **small-cap group no longer reflects a competitive set of risky but high-upside firms**; rather, it includes a disproportionate share of structurally inefficient entities whose survival biases the return distribution downward and increases tail risk.\n\nThis zombification effect is **likely to depress the average excess return and Sharpe ratio of the small-cap segment**, while simultaneously increasing the variance and skewness of returns. Though this paper does not directly model zombie firm identification, the empirical pattern—lower mean, higher volatility, greater downside asymmetry in small-cap returns—is consistent with this interpretation.\n\nThus, the **efficiency erosion in capital markets is dual-channel**:  \n- **Top-heavy concentration** reinforces structural dominance and allocative inertia.  \n- **Bottom-heavy zombification** distorts the return-generating process and weakens the innovation–destruction cycle.\n\n## 5. The TBTF Strategy and Its Paradox\n\nWithin this environment, the study evaluates a simple yet powerful investment strategy: the **TBTF portfolio**, which selects the 10 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization from the full CRSP universe (NYSE, Nasdaq, AMEX), applies a quadratic weighting scheme based on rank, and rebalances at fixed intervals (e.g., monthly).\n\nEmpirical results show that this strategy has delivered **exceptional risk-adjusted performance**, particularly after 2010. The strategy outperforms major indices and alternative benchmarks across multiple metrics, including Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Omega ratio, and maximum drawdown—while maintaining low turnover.\n\nYet the strategy’s success raises a paradox. It is **“sadly optimal”**:  \n- If the strategy **continues to succeed**, it signals a persistent mispricing and a further decline in market efficiency.  \n- If the strategy **fails**, it suggests a return to competitive capital allocation and improved economic welfare.  \nIn either case, it remains optimal from an individual investor’s standpoint, but potentially damaging from a societal perspective.\n\n## 6. Capital Mobility, Lock-In, and Polarization\n\nA key innovation in this study is the use of **percentile-based Markov transition matrices** and **stationary capital share distributions** to analyze capital mobility. The findings indicate that:\n\n- Top decile firms exhibit extremely high persistence, acting as near-absorbing states.\n- Lower decile firms display high volatility and minimal upward transition probability.\n- The stationary distribution of capital shares shows **growing convexity** over time, resembling a structural Lorenz curve.\n- Mobility inequality, measured via entropy and upward/downward transition asymmetry, is worsening.\n\nThese features mirror **social stratification**, where economic agents (firms, in this case) become locked into hierarchical capital classes, resulting in reduced dynamism and allocative efficiency.\n\n## 7.
