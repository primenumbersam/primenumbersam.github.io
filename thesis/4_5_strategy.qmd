## Strategy: Design, Assumptions, and Market Philosophy

### Motivation and Theoretical Background

Traditional asset pricing frameworks rest on no-arbitrage principles and risk-return tradeoffs, assuming that all assets exist to offer compensation for exposure to priced risks. Under such models, individual asset returns are interpreted as linear functions of sensitivities to systematic risk factors.

In contrast, the TBTF (Too Big To Fail) strategy is motivated by a fundamentally different view of financial markets under late-stage capitalism. We argue that the secondary stock market reflects persistent dominance by a small subset of firms whose market power is self-reinforcing. These firms attract new capital not due to risk-efficiency, but due to narrative-driven legitimacy and path-dependent concentration of initial endowment.

This motivates a strategy grounded not in diversification or risk exposure, but in capital persistence, market lock-in, and capital hierarchy.


### Portfolio Selection Rule

The TBTF strategy is constructed under When-What–How framework:

- **When**: look-back window (in-sample estimation) & look-forward window (rebalancing frequency)
- **What**: asset universe (e.g. all US-listed stocks) & selection rule (e.g. top-n market cap)
- **How**: asset weighting scheme (e.g. convex capital concentration fit)

#### Asset Universe

Our strategy operates on the full set of U.S. listed common stocks traded on NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX. Stocks with non-positive market capitalization are excluded to avoid bankrupt or illiquid firms.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect(database="../../tbtf.sqlite")

crsp = pd.read_sql_query(
  sql="SELECT * FROM crsp",
  con=con,
  parse_dates={"date"}
)
```

#### Ranking and State Formation

Each month, firms are ranked by market capitalization. These rankings define discrete capital states (percentile bins). We focus on the top-decile (state = 10), selecting the top-$n$ firms at time $t$ based on market-cap rank. The baseline is $n=10$, with robustness checks for $n \in \{5, 7, 10, 15, 20\}$.

A Markovian state transition framework is imposed to capture the temporal dynamics of capital flow between ranked states. The top state exhibits persistent and asymmetric capital retention, supporting the capital lock-in hypothesis.

### Asset Weighting Schemes

We evaluate three portfolio weighting methods:

- **TBTF (Convex Structural Weighting)**:  
  Capital weights are determined by in-sample estimates of the convex relationship between market-cap rank and capital share. Two specifications are considered:

  - *Quadratic Form*: $w_i \propto \alpha + \beta r_i + \gamma r_i^2$
  - *Exponential Form*: $w_i \propto \alpha e^{\beta r_i}$
  
  The exponential form better fits observed capital share concentration and ensures structural monotonicity.

- **Value-Weighted (VW)**:  
  Proportional to each firm’s market capitalization.

- **Equal-Weighted (EQ)**:  
  Uniform allocation across all selected assets.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from tbtf import (
    estimate_exponential_weights,
    estimate_quadratic_weights,
    split_in_out_sample,
    plot_exponential_fit,
    plot_quadratic_fit
)

```


#### Empirical Fit of Capital Share Functions

To empirically validate the structural weighting functions, we fit both quadratic and exponential models to the in-sample relationship between rank and capital share. The following plots show the cross-sectional fitting results based on a representative rebalance date.


```{python}
in_end = '2009-12-31'
in_sample_months = 48

print('Snapshot at:', in_end)
print('Look-back period:', in_sample_months, 'months')

df_in_sample, _ = split_in_out_sample(crsp, in_end, in_sample_months)
```

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Quadratic vs. Exponential Fit at 2009-12-31"
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

plot_quadratic_fit(df_in_sample, n=10, state=10, ax=axes[0])
plot_exponential_fit(df_in_sample, n=10, state=10, ax=axes[1])

fig.suptitle(f"Fitted Capital Share Functions at {in_end}")
plt.tight_layout()
```

```{python}
in_end = '2023-12-31'
in_sample_months = 48

print('Snapshot at:', in_end)
print('Look-back period:', in_sample_months, 'months')

df_in_sample, _ = split_in_out_sample(crsp, in_end, in_sample_months)
```

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Quadratic vs. Exponential Fit at 2023-12-31"
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

plot_quadratic_fit(df_in_sample, n=10, state=10, ax=axes[0])
plot_exponential_fit(df_in_sample, n=10, state=10, ax=axes[1])

fig.suptitle(f"Fitted Capital Share Functions at {in_end}")
plt.tight_layout()
```

These cross-sectional plots confirm the superiority of the exponential fit in capturing the accelerating concentration of capital among top-ranked firms. The difference is especially pronounced in the post-2010 sample, reflecting a structural shift in capital dynamics during the QE era.

The exponential fit exhibits stronger monotonicity and structural convexity, particularly in the top-ranked firms, supporting its use in the TBTF weighting scheme.


### Rebalancing Frequency

We test fixed-interval rebalancing schemes:

- Monthly (default)
- Quarterly
- Semiannual
- Annual

Rebalancing frequency directly affects turnover and transaction cost implications. Monthly rebalancing is selected as the baseline to balance responsiveness with frictions.


### Benchmark Portfolios

For external comparison, we use:

- **Pre-2010 Index Benchmarks**: Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), Nasdaq-100 (^NDX)
- **Post-2010 Index ETFs**: 
  - DIA (ETF version of DJIA, State Street Corporation ETF. Fund inception: 1998/01/14), 
  - QQQ (ETF version of NDX. Nasdaq-100 ticker. the Invesco QQQ Trust. Fund inception: 1999/03/10), 
  - SPY (The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, Fund inception: 1993/01/22), 
  - VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, Fund inception: 2001년 5월 24일), 
- **Post-2010 Style Portfolios**: Fama-French ME5 × PRIOR1/3/5, constructed with rolling monthly value- or equal-weighting


### Strategic Rationale

The TBTF strategy is not merely a rule-based selection method. It reflects a structural argument that allocative efficiency in modern markets is compromised by persistent capital concentration. Instead of diversifying away idiosyncratic risk, markets are increasingly dominated by capital lock-in, hierarchy reinforcement, and narrative legitimacy.

This framework reconceptualizes the role of financial assets from carriers of risk to vehicles of structural dominance, and evaluates portfolio construction in light of this altered paradigm.


## Appendix: TBTF Strategy Pipeline {.appendix}

This section outlines the modular structure of the TBTF portfolio strategy, from input specification to out-of-sample return generation and performance evaluation. The pipeline is designed to be flexible across different weighting schemes, rebalance frequencies, and strategy parameters.

### Inputs (Arguments)

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `df` | Main input DataFrame (`crsp`) including fields such as `date`, `permno`, `mktcap`, `ret`, `state`, `mktcap_lag`, etc. |
| `state_level` | Target capital state to define the asset universe, typically the top decile (e.g., `10`). |
| `top_n` | Number of assets to be selected at each rebalance point (e.g., `n ∈ {5, 10, 20, 30, 50}`). |
| `rebalance_freq` | Rebalancing interval (e.g., `'1M'`, `'3M'`, `'6M'`, `'12M'`). |
| `weighting_method` | One of `'equal'`, `'value'`, `'quadratic'`, or `'exponential'`. |
| `in_sample_period` | Estimation window for in-sample weight calibration (e.g., `'2010-01-01'` to `'2013-12-31'`). |
| `out_sample_period` | Evaluation window for out-of-sample backtesting (e.g., `'2014-01-01'` to `'2023-12-31'`). |
| `eta`, `p` | Parameters for CRRA utility (`eta`) and Omega ratio threshold (`p`). |


### Strategy Pipeline (Pseudo-code Logic)

#### Step 1: Data Partitioning & Filtering

```python
in_sample = df[(df['date'] >= in_sample_start) & (df['date'] <= in_sample_end)]
out_sample = df[(df['date'] > in_sample_end) & (df['date'] <= out_sample_end)]
universe = df[df['state'] == state_level]
```

- Restrict selection universe to target capital state (e.g., top decile).


#### Step 2: In-sample Weight Estimation

If `weighting_method` is `'quadratic'` or `'exponential'`:

- Estimate the relationship between within-state rank and capital share using in-sample data:
  - Quadratic:  
    $$\text{CapShare}_i = \alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Rank}_i + \gamma \cdot \text{Rank}_i^2$$
  - Exponential:  
    $$\text{CapShare}_i = \alpha \cdot e^{\beta \cdot \text{Rank}_i}$$
- Save estimated coefficients:
  ```python
  coefficients = {'alpha': ..., 'beta': ..., 'gamma': ...}
  ```

#### Step 3: Out-of-sample Portfolio Construction

For each rebalance date in the out-sample period:

1. Filter to target state (`state == state_level`)
2. Rank by market cap, select top `n`
3. Assign weights:
   - Equal: $w_i = 1/n$
   - Value: $w_i = \text{mktcap}_i / \sum \text{mktcap}$
   - Quadratic: apply $\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}, \hat{\gamma}$ to rank
   - Exponential: apply $\hat{\alpha}, \hat{\beta}$ to rank
4. Store `[date, permno, weight]` for forward return application


#### Step 4: Portfolio Return Computation

At each evaluation date after rebalance:

- Merge forward returns of selected assets
- Compute portfolio return:
  $$R_t^{\text{portfolio}} = \sum_i w_{i,t} \cdot r_{i,t}$$
- Construct time series of out-of-sample portfolio returns


#### Step 5: Turnover Calculation

For each rebalance window:

- Calculate:
  $$\text{Turnover}_t = \sum_i |w_{i,t} - w_{i,t-1}|$$
- Useful for assessing transaction costs and liquidity requirements


#### Step 6: Performance Evaluation

Using out-of-sample return series, compute:

- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**:
  - Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
  - Omega ratio (threshold = `p`)
  - Calmar ratio, maximum drawdown (MDD)
  - CRRA utility with risk aversion parameter `eta`

- Return summary as dictionary:
  ```python
  metrics_dict = {
      'Sharpe': ...,
      'Sortino': ...,
      'Omega': ...,
      'CRRA': ...,
      'CAGR': ...,
      'MDD': ...
  }
  ```


### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `returns_df` | Time series of out-of-sample portfolio returns |
| `weights_df` | Portfolio composition (weights per date and permno) |
| `turnover_df` | Time series of turnover at each rebalance point |
| `metrics_dict` | Dictionary of strategy performance metrics |
