# Structural Shifts in the Financial Market

## 1. 2010 as a Structural Break

This study defines **January 1, 2010** as a structural break in the evolution of U.S. financial markets. This point marks a transition from a period of crisis-driven volatility and deregulation to an era characterized by **policy-dominated asset inflation, ETF proliferation, and asymmetric capital flows**. By segmenting the data at this breakpoint, we aim to assess how financial market performance and capital concentration evolved across two distinct regimes.

The dataset spans **January 1996 to December 2023**, with a monthly frequency. It is segmented as follows:

- **Pre-2010**: 1996–2009  
- **Post-2010**: 2010–2023

The segmentation provides a clean empirical framework to evaluate the impact of structural policy interventions and evolving capital dynamics.

## 2. Historical Context of Each Period

### Pre-2010: Volatility, Deregulation, and Crisis

The pre-2010 period includes several global shocks and deregulation episodes:

- **1997 Asian Financial Crisis**
- **Dot-com Bubble and Crash (2000–2001)**
- **9/11 Terror Attacks (2001)**
- **Repeal of Glass-Steagall (1999)**, which contributed to systemic risk buildup
- **Global Financial Crisis (2008–2009)**, culminating in the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the implementation of TARP

This was an era of market discontinuity, high volatility, and risk repricing, where asset allocation was still driven largely by fundamentals and discretionary investing.

### Post-2010: QE Regime and Capital Lock-In

In contrast, the post-2010 era reflects a **policy-driven financial environment**, where capital markets were shaped by:

- **Quantitative Easing (QE1, QE2, QE3)**
- **Passive flows via ETF proliferation**
- **Technological monopolization**
- **COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented stimulus**
- **AI-fueled equity valuations post-2023**

These changes have amplified top-heavy capital concentration and reinforced inertia in market leadership. Importantly, they enabled the survival of inefficient firms at the lower end (zombie firms), distorting the small-cap return distribution.

## 3. US Top 10 Stability: Empirical Snapshot

An empirical motivation for the TBTF strategy lies in the historical persistence of top-cap firms. From 2012 to 2023, only **27 unique PERMNOs** appeared in the top 10 by market cap. These include:

- **AAPL**, **MSFT**, **AMZN**, **GOOG**, **META**, **NVDA**, **TSLA**
- Traditional blue chips like **XOM**, **JNJ**, **WMT**, **JPM**, **BAC**
- Healthcare and consumer giants like **UNH**, **LLY**, **PG**, **KO**
- Financials and telcos like **BRK**, **MA**, **V**, **T**, **VZ**

This concentration implies that capital has become locked into a narrow subset of firms, with little room for new entrants—an observation with profound implications for allocative efficiency and market competition.

- U.S. equities constitute nearly half of global equity market capitalization. 
- The dominance of U.S. firms in global equity rankings
